I hope the makers of this movie are happy, they made me waste 1,5 hours of my life a left me puzzled with greatest question of all time: will there ever be a movie thats worse then this? I have to say I started watching this movie with skeptic thoughts in my mind, but not even in my worst nightmares would I have seen what was before me. The dialog is a waste of breath, they could have had "Band X" play random songs for 1,5 hours on top of the movie instead of the dialog and it would have made exactly the same amount of sense. The special effects are like from the 80-s, and even then they would have been below average, the acting is below zero. This movie was actually so bad it forced me to register to IMDb so I could rant about it so at least it achieved something good. The only time I could recommend spending time with this movie is ... well lets face it: never.
Its a doomsday not for the all humankind but to the ill fated ones who are doomed to watch it. A real disaster starting from misguided storyline,dumb acting,pathetic dialogues and supreme bad direction. The dialogues are real crap. one is "The world is falling apart and so i want to know you are safe"..And the special effects reminds me of some late seventies movies .I mean some of them had much better effects. Starts with doomsday countdown of your patience and unlike the world's fate (saved of course by talking to god )u are out of any patience. Uff pathetic.. give me back my lost 90 minutes.. I am planning to invest in inventing time travel to get it back.. Never ever watch it..if u dare u will have your doomsday...
This is a bad film.The plot is the most idiotic thing I remember watching in a long time.The "god message" takes form after 15 minutes of watching, so you end up waiting just one more minute because you just cant believe what you're seeing.There's some amazing bad acting going on, like people talking in panic for almost no reason, or doing the most absurd things. Even plain cell phones work in the jungle.Its a film made for people with short horizons and no brains. Its an excuse to spread the "word of god". And its done in the dumbest, lamest, least appealing way....and I do love all genres of cinema.
When i first started watching this movie I taught to myself "how bad can it be?! it will be at least a decent watchable movie .." . I was wrong .This movie is just horrible . Everything in it is badly done , including the acting . I doubt there is one thing anyone will like about this movie . I can even say it is the worst movie I have seen in my entire life ! I have never rated a movie with 1 until now.I just want to know : was this a low budget movie ? Because if it was I would somehow understand why I was put trough this horror of watching this movie . Special effects are like in the '50s , the acting is like of 10 year old kids , the attention to details is non existent , the background sound is probably from another movie . And this is only the stuff i can think about now .I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone , not even the people i hate .. If you think of watching this movie DON'T ! Skip directly to "Cloverfield" if you want to see a new good action movie . I know i should have done the same !
This film is the worst piece of biblical garbage i have ever seen. I really wish that i had looked it up on here first to save myself the pain of watching it. The acting is horrible, and the story is even worse. The CG parts are trash, not even suitable for those "TV movies" that they make for the sole purpose for TV, like the Poseidon adventure that was on NBC. However, at least that movie had a suitable storyline to make up for the bad acting and unsatisfying graphics. I would gladly be forced to watch black and white TV for the remainder of my life than have to watch this piece of trash again. Sorry to all you believers out there...
This movie promises something interesting but just delivers Christian religious propaganda, poor CGI effects, far-from-good actors and a very clich√© story.I'm really unable to understand why people would spend money to film a movie like that, it's a waste of money, just it. Perhaps some people gets some nice tax reduction investing in films like that because I doubt it makes enough money to worth the trouble.If you want some religious propaganda plus wasting your time and money, feel free to rent/buy and watch this movie. I you want a good advise, rent another movie and never think about this one, even if it's in the bargain basket.
I couldn't spoil anything because there is nothing to spoil. Words could not convey the ......... of this film. You see I can't even find a word to say how bad it is. I can't believe when they were making the film or even writing it, that they couldn't see they were making a mistake. The actors seem to be trying to act as badly as possible. The story line is right out of the Sunday morning Davy and Goliath writers trash bin. You can't say this film is good for nothing, it can always be used as a good example of a bad film.When I think of the money lost and the time I wasted I want to cry. If the story is true, they should have spared us and released it on 12-25-2012
Don't bother. Complete waste of time with no redeeming features. Some of the effects are passable I suppose, but the scrip and the wooden acting combined with the mixed mess of the basic religious undertones...yuck.The music sucks, the pacing sucks, read the other comments and stay far away, the only reason to watch this would be with a few friends, some beer and for free as something to laugh at.Silly string rain, computer graphics probably done in paint, text overlays with typing noise, generic characters,silly string used as "rain" text cant really express just how bad this thing is.
Should have been alerted by the "Christian Epic" reference, thought it was an apocalyptic movie in the line of the 7th Sign. It indeed deals with the end of the world and the usual heroes that somehow convince God through some ordeal that He should let us apes live a little longer. But where movies like the 7th Seal grip you by script and acting, this one will bore you to tears. Acting is awful, the dialogs are out of bad evangelical early morning TV, plot and subplot lines make no sense at all. You'll need a lobotomy to watch this one with anything other than utter boredom and a sense that Armageddon must indeed be near for something like this to be thought of, let alone be produced.
Features of this movie: bad acting , visual effects made with a home PC, bad directing, useless talk scenes, bad screenplay, bad dialogs (where the writers on strike?! - actually they were... and you can tell!), fake rain made with a bunch of shower heads, very bad casting and totally random music. With a decent cast, screenwriters and a director, it would have been a 7+ movie. This looks like something you can make with your friends, a PC and a handy-cam. Actually NO, I've seen much better short films on Youtube. Total waste of my time. This movie is even worst then 'The Helix... Loaded'.
what an awful movie, spare your self the horror of sitting through this. Nothing but bad acting, ridiculous special effects and the worst story you could possibly imagine. Nothing in this movie even enters the realm of possibility and just is a giant display of stupidity.If you have a suspicion that someone one you know may be an absolute moron, have them watch this movie then ask them what they think of it. If they say anything positive about it you should never speak to them again. Just talking to someone who understands this movie will lower your intelligence.the writer and director of this movie, Nick Everhart, should be barred from even touching a pen or a camera again. please someone save us from this insane man.
'rrichkj's review of this film nearly killed me - I laughed so hard my bowel ended up next to me in my bed - which made up for watching 40 minutes of this total crap. Danae Nason's face had a strange effect on me. Now feeling like I wanted to vomit, now wanting to punch myself in the face, now head-butt the wall. The film was emotional viewing. I didn't realize how bad it was until I hit the stop button - I had scratched out my left eye. God knows if I hadn't hit the stop button I wouldn't be alive to join IMDb.com and to make my first ever comment. I see Danae Nason has done another movie since called ' Countdown Jerusalem ' - Tag line 'The end isn't near... It's here'. Oooooh - I bet that's a good movie...
I want my hour and a half AND my $5.00 back! If you like watching sh!t and sh!t that doesn't even pertain to the actual Mayan Callender, then this is your movie! Just because different religions and especially extinct religions state a possible "Doomsday" does not make it in anyway Christian. Save your money and play the lottery. It has better odds than this steaming pile of Sh!t!It sucks huge donkey balls!!!Please save your money!Spend it on something worthwhile!!!
that was the worst, poorest and cheapest American Movie i have ever seen. i suggest anyone whom believe in Jesus to see this Movie and understand what poor God he believes in. trustfully i have seen some movies like this one, but you know where? in Islamic Mollah s' TV, there are some people die in these movies and from the beginning everybody just crying and praying they don't even think to the happenings and then out of no where the God Mirecilly solve everything.At the end of the movie you saw that the day is finished and the night starts but after few minutes that the child born-ed, we saw the sunshine again this means that they believe that the God have a Rope to the earth and after the birth he simply shake the rope so the direction of earth circling changed(something that can never happen).i think it is just ridiculing what people believe instead of bringing them to believe. the more worst thing is that the director and the writer saying with this Movie that there is just one shape of belief that is true and that is Christians beliefs. i 'm so sorry for all the people worked in this Movie and even i 'm sorry for myself to put some time to watch this.
I felt I was cheated after I finished this film. So I googled this film and I found out it's one of the Worst movie. I read these comments on IMDb. Some of them are really funny. i didn't have fun with this film, but i enjoy reading the comments on this film. Just like one comment says, "You can't say this film is good for nothing, it can always be used as a good example of a bad film". To me, it caused some funny comments. And just as another comment says, "I have never commented on a film, but I registered in this web to vent my frustration. I registered in this web to share the pleasure to read all these great comments on this film.
Hello friends,This film has nothing realistic in it!The only great things is it are the stunts and the special effects, otherwise is a piece of junk.It is trying to mix some biblical events with some cross and some tribe that has and had no connection whatsoever.Also, there are so many things that are mixing the good and bad, up to the point where you don't know what's true an what's a lie. I don't know who directed this and what was in his/her mind, but he/she needs to read that the truth is found in SOMEONE not somewhere else.Take care!
I had very low expectations of this movie. But being somewhat of a sadist and a glutton for punishment, I endured through.The acting is definitely not first rate, but I was expecting worse. There are some performances that are worse than others. On the whole it was tolerable, barely, with the exception of the final speech which sounded like a reading from a student on the first day of freshman drama class.The general story has the potential for a decent movie. Its all the praying and God references that are beyond distracting. If the writers and producers of this movie would have made a little more effort to entertain and not quite so much to push "the message", it might have been slightly more tolerable.The effects were not great, but not so bad as to distract from the story.The production quality and cinematography weren't too bad. Its probably the deciding factor why I didn't give this a 1. It actually seemed like a real movie.Unless you are a hard core sadist for movies like me, spare yourself the time to see this and sit in the lobby of a multiplex and people watch for free. Don't go see this unless "the power of Christ compels you."
I see all the comments about how bad this movie was. I thought it was an OK film. Sure it is not a big budget disaster movie and I do not believe they were trying to make one. I feel this one was made to be shown in churches or other like minded places.The movie had a message that was lost on most that rented this one. It is what it is. A good clean spiritual end of the world picture, that you would not mind if youngsters watched.So all in all I liked the movie and would indeed recommend it to my friends.
I was impressed with the look of this film... especially if you take the time to consider the tiny budget. This film faces impossible odds if it is stacked up against the Hollywood blockbusters that boast $100 million + dollar budgets. For a film with such restraints (limited time and money)to produce such an impossible film, it is actually a good movie. Wait good? Seriously.I'll grant you- the script was written in a matter of days and is a far cry from a work of art. The concept itself was thrown away in the edit to appease the demands of Christian buyers. A big part of the movie was botched in hopes to sell more copies. The directing was good for such a short production schedule. Acting? Well, the ADR makes actors look weaker than they actually are. It is a shame that so many people are blind to the facts of movie making and smash this film, going so far as to say the director should kill himself. REALLY? This film was made with less than 1/10 the time of a big blockbuster and not even 1/100 of the budget.I hope Nick Everhart gets a chance to prove everyone wrong by taking time to write a serious script. Given time and money it won't be hard for him to prove all these amateurs wrong. Maybe you all should take a moment and use your brain before you critique a film without knowing the facts of what it takes to make a movie. Thanks.
An amazing story of home and redemption in a time when the world is flooded with media images of disaster and destruction. While the story line has some Christian bible derived items, and tells of an amazing journey of faith, it is still a fictional work and not to be thought of as a bibical prediction of the end of the world. The soundtrack of the movie is a must have. The music is perfectly matched to the movie and inspiring. If you are looking for a Christian friendly movie, then this is it. If you are looking for the glitz and glam of Hollywood, then this is not your movie. This is not a movie for critics. This movie is about faith and spirituality, not camera angles and things being "normal". The acting in the movie is realistic and true. The nature scenes are beautiful. This movie may be to dramatic for immature or young audiences without bibical explanation.
