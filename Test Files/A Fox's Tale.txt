Kis Vuk is probably the worst animation sequel ever made. The first episode was a classic cartoon created by Attila Dargay in 1981. It had a remarkable Hungarian and international career, and a whole generation grown up on it.In spite of the new project had enough money, the quality of graphic is ridiculous in 2008. Not just the scenes and characters are obsolete, but the animation of characters is unnatural and amateurish. This sequel is a mockery of the original movie and it is a shame for the creators.The Hungarian animation industry has a lot of talents and qualitative products, Kis Vuk is an exception.
Even if this ugly thing does not even looks like a cartoon movie, probably been a prosperous business - if money laundering and wasting national sponsorship is considered to be a success. This is a picture perfect specimen of the deeply rooted corruption that so sadly penetrates its developer country at all level.Don't be mistaken, it is simply not a movie to watch, its sole purpose was described above. Frankly, it still has a positive side: so very filled with primitive errors that you definitely not want to commit if you ever make animated films that you can actually learn from it. However, it is quite long for a "how-not-to-do-a-cartoon" tutorial, and there are continuously repeating faults that are tiresome.Truly a visual poison, should be forbidden to minors, its not made for them. It is made for the money, and the money only.
...and now, something completely different: the same nightmare with English voices: "A Fox's Tale (2008)" = "Kis Vuk (2008)" -> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0830861/ This so-called CG-movie is just not what it seems. Lets take a closer look (careful!), at first glance it looks like a CG-movie, with some cartoon animals and stuff. However, it is substandard by all means. A grand insult against the Hungarian CG- and cartoon industry. Quality is not amateurish - it would put a shame on most of the amateurs who ever tried to make a coloured teapot in 3dsmax. A clear show-off that nobody gave a fox about how it would be a movie. It was just business. And they had the money before they done anything with it. A flagship of the money laundering system, where politicians and producers steal from the citizens on every level of life. This is not a cartoon-film for children. This is a triumph of corruption.
This movie is the same as the Kis Vuk, the only difference are the dubbed English voices. So by IMDb rules it shouldn't be listed as a separate movie. I guess the producers just wanted to start with a clean record, since Kis Vuk has a user rating of 1,6 after 2000+ votes, thus it's the worst flick in the animation category on IMDb.And rightly so. This movie is just a blatant disgrace, especially if we consider that the original Vuk was so dear to so many people. It's nothing more but a shameful ripoff, a steal of state sponsorship money and it's a disgrace to the creators of the original movie. So I'm not surprised at all that it is now listed under a separate title. Fortunately you can't hide basic facts on the Internet.
First of all, this movie is at the bottom 100 at IMDb already, but with the Hungarian name ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0830861/ ). So, the director saw, what a piece of .... he made, and try to re-distribute it under an English title. You can see the comments on the other one, this is what I can say here too. The original Vuk was an all time classic, this one is a waste of money. Early 90's level animation, no storyline. Strange as it is, they had 1.6 billion Forints (10 mils USD) for this project, so they used it for something, but in a very eastern-European, non-professional way. So, avoid it at all cost!! The only reason you'd be watching this is to get a good taste of how a movie can be awful!!
Really not much more left to mock about this title, but because it's a fine tutorial how NOT to make a film (or anything else!), I think, I should gather the scraps and flush them too down the toilet.I really tried to watch this from beginning to end. I tried hard, but I failed. From the first time I saw the trailer of this disaster, I was sure, I really gonna enjoy watching it while simultaneously beating its every aspect... But it's just too much. It's not possible to sit through this movie.The movie begins with a bunch of ugly bunnies jumping through a horribly rendered forest. No anti-aliasing can be seen, nor motion blur, or anything. My eyes begun to hurt. They begin to whine, which is annoying, and you can see the credits nailed onto the trees, which looks like manure, and then a truck comes. Or goes. It's moving, that's for sure, but one couldn't tell where it goes, because the storyboard artist was a dead skunk. So this truck comes, and almost hits the bunnies, but i really don't know how the hell they saw it coming, and they jump down the road and run into the forest. The virtual cameramen work already made me nauseous, but this is the point where someone shoots his balls off with a salt-gun. The picture starts to move rapidly to totally random directions and I begin to feel sick. They bump into another bunny, which at least stops the seizure of the cinematographer, but then, this butt-ugly, and badly rendered crow starts to do his rap... That's quite bad already, but I cant even make a word out of it!!! It supposed to be a children's movie! In the forest our eyes must deal with the horrible high contrast shadows of the branches, which makes the characters blend into the similarly messy background... If something looks quite okay, you can be sure its a stock object. And you already witnessed a lot of free stock sounds too! And now we are at the fifth minute of this "experience"... I couldn't ever watch through 00:20:00.Some people compare the look of this movie to mid 90's video game intros. Now that's just a misunderstanding. Pre-rendered (and even in-game) movies on those consoles has been based on real movie clichés, therefore all our perceptions of movies met, and we enjoyed them even despite the primitive technology they used to make them. People who made Kis Vuk are clearly NOT professional filmmakers. Not one of them ever worked on a film (being credited doesn't mean a thing). And even worse: they don't have a clue about how a movie works!!! Even if you watch the original Star-Wars trilogy just once, and you never watch any other movie in your whole life, you already have far more information about film-making, than to get a way with a mess like Kis Vuk!Before someone gets the idea, that I'm being too harsh, I must tell, that nothing can prepare you for this. Even I was surprised, despite I'm one true b-movie fan! It's really that incredibly bad! Final word: if you want to find out all things that could go wrong while making a movie, witness this disaster. Really enlightening.Update: I was being forced to sit this through recently, so now I've seen the whole movie from the first frame to the very last of the credits. And it always managed to amaze me. Once I got used to all those problems listed above, and managed to look below the surface which as I said is hideous, all i saw was a pretty awful children's movie, with a plot that makes no sense... I'm saying "pretty awful", and not the "stinkiest pile of manure"!I begun to feel quite ashamed for being that harsh earlier... "you know it is really bad, but hey, I've seen worse..." But every time I started to think like that, something horrible happened on my screen which proved that this movie deserves the beating it got. And the worst part is this: despite the movies concept to stun me with its horrendousness whenever I start to accept it, it was incredibly boring (and it's less than 90 minutes long!)!The credits are a treat. They knew this movie's gonna suck, and people gonna yell at the screen: "What the hell did you do during the production you lazy morons?!?!?!". So beside the scrolling list of names, we get a little "making-of" montage on the other half of the frame. "See? We worked hard! You can't say we didn't! We have video evidence!" I'm just speechless. And not because I'm convinced. And for now, let me part with the last few sentences I heard at the end of the credits: -Little Vuk is frightening! Everyone is afraid of Little Vuk!
Same movie with different voices.Look at: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0830861/ The original title was: Kis Vuk (2008) Let me show some earlier comments, because that is the true: "Author: DjFlanker from Hungary Avoid Kis Vuk at all cost; try to erase even its name from your memory.Anyone forcing/allowing her/his child to see this "thing" should be executed immediately.Your DS or PSP has WAY better graphics, animation, effects, voices, sound and everything than this.Compared with Kis Vuk, the movie receiving the worst rating on IMDb is a multiple Oscar-winning epic masterpiece.I wish I was joking when writing this comment..If you want to see quality Hungarian animation, do not miss the original "Vuk" (1981), and Cat City.Try Egon & Dönci to see a quality Hungarian CGI animation movie.And remember: NEVER, EVER.. "
It is exactly the same movie as "Kis Vuk" (http://www.IMDb.com/title/tt0830861/) The only difference is, it's with English dubbing. Doesn't make the "story" and the "quality" of the "animation" any better.Sad thing is, that the original piece, "Vuk" is a wonderful tale from 1981 and the creators of this new thing only used the original title for marketing purposes. Same reason why they have it up on IMDb under a new title for the English dubbing. It's a shame that they can do it!I definitely don't recommend watching it, unless you wanna feel the pain each and every one of us had to suffer when we tried to watch it. My 5 years old niece almost cried by the end of it, she was terrified by the fox and some of the other animals too. The fox's eyes look evil! How can that happen to a movie supposedly made for children? The old Vuk is a classic piece, I'd watch it anytime, but this one? Thanks, but no thanks!
I love animation, and have seen a lot of animated movies, old and new, good and bad. I only saw this out of curiosity, having seen many of my IMDb friends putting this movie on their worst animated movies list, so I wanted to see whether it was really that bad. And to me it was that bad. In fact I have not seen an animated movie this awful since about July with Space Thunder Kids. The animation is among the laziest I've seen, the character designs look ugly, no make that hideous, the colours are flat and the backgrounds and sceneries are horribly rendered. The writing is some of the worst I've heard in a long time, all the lines are banal, verging on preachy and very unfocused. The story is dull, futile and thin even for the running time. I will say I have seen the 1981 film Vuk(of which this is a sequel of), that was charming, well animated, beautifully voiced and written. This sequel is the complete opposite, not only does it "rip-off" the 1981 film but it completely fails to capture the spirit and style of it, let alone its heart. The voice work is poor, with the voices out of sync sometimes with the lip movements. This voice cast(Freddie Highmore, Bill Nighy, Miranda Richardson and Sienna Miller) is talented, but they are wasted with awful writing and dumb characters we don't give a toss about. Overall, just a mess. 1/10 Bethany Cox
It's a piece of... I mean, originally this was one of the best Hungarian cartoons (1981), you have to read the book, to finish elementary school. But this... this is shame. Why is it have to happen? When I saw the trailer I said: screw this I will never watch it! But then I said myself: don't judge the book by it's cover. I don't knew, what I'm about to see. At the half of the film, I left the cinema. I don't know, and somehow, I don't care about what will happen to the characters. After a month, nobody talked about it.So watch the first one, The little fox (this is the English as far as I know).
Mainly, for the English reviewers. Gyorgy Gat, who made this outrage, called "movie". So he had good contacts with the ex-socialist government cultural secretary and this movie got money from four state source. It was not 5 million euro,5,5. 0,5 million euro were missing. So it was a big big theft. This is simply corruption. The original "Vuk" made in 1981, but i think, it's not translated for English, but, the original Vuk is great, beauty and has story, where the humans are evils, and the film don't show their face, only their weapons and the destruction what they caused. And the fox was a symbol of freedom. The best animated movie what ever created in Hungary. But this, soil the memory of the Vuk novel writer Istvan Fekete and the creator of original Vuk movie Attila Dargay.
When looking for movie reviews, I try to steer away from the 1* category. They're usually overly biased rantings, with much regret over the money spent on the movie ticket/DVD/blu-ray, and some form to get over the cognitive dissonance felt over this ill transaction.However, in the case of this title, each and every 1* review is well deserved, and I guess many of my fellow reviewers would've given 0 star if they could.I wanted to write a long review about how bad this movie really is, how classic the first installment was, and how it humiliates this garbage in every aspect, no matter if you try to judge this one in the light of it's predecessor, or as a stand-alone work.But I won't because I was unable to bear it on the screen for more than 23 minutes. Simply put, there's not a single positive trait I can write about this film. It is a disgrace for the entire Hungarian film making, and the movie industry in general.At best, it was a blantant and outrageous attempt to steal government money in the form of art subsidy. At worst they thought the entire "thing" seriously, and made it deliberately THAT wrong.Avoid it at all cost.
Do you know, when you are watching a sequel to movie you loved? Well,that's not a case with Kis Vuk, which was advertised as one to a Hungarian Classic. But compared to the original, it looks more like a rip-off than a material related to it. Not a sequel at all.Mockbusters are movies that piggyback on the publicity of popular works, hence the similar title, but They do not tend to be released in cinemas, let alone have the same treatment as Kis Vuk did in Hungary, BUT: It's Animation is just demonic, it's characters are non-existent, bland, and ugly, just as everything. There is no story, at all. The love-stories are forced and just doesn't fit the Vuk Lore. Gát would argue, but well, I don't think He was sane the whole time He was directing it. And I shall be dead if the whole "Budget", namely 5 million Euro, and 1,4 Billion Forint, was at all used for this Mockbuster. But well, who knows what kind of mental disease Gát has, it probably involves greed. If you are making something a sequel, do not make the characters take on a new style, nor redesign anyone drastically. And this movie just shits on that, thinking it will have any sort of success being the controversy it is. A sequel should also have ALL connections to its predecessor. Well, we saw no proof to that. And the fact we see the face of the humans? We would have seen at least one in "The Little Tramp" but at least it knew what it was hiding. In Kis Vuk, we are not afraid of any of the humans, despite humans being seen as evil in the face of the hunted animals. Sound effects include only sounds from a free downloadable archive, and a lot of sounds are repeated a million times, very noticeably. And those songs? Are you freaking kidding Me? Probably the Craze for Justin Bieber, whose haters are proved right by this day, inspired them, except that one character that doesn't even fit what's happening. And did I tell you about the camera-motion? It's not helping. Trust me, it's making it worse to make out anything from the movie. And there are also objects in it, which would have fit in a Inspector Gadget ripoff, but In something supposedly about the son of Vuk, it's just not fitting.In short, it lacks a story, it lacks characters, and it looks and sounds like a sketch, rather than a complete movie. As I said, out of the 1,4 Billion Forints, no money went into this production. If some did, wasn't more than, maximum, a few thousands. The main problem: It is selling itself out as the sequel to Vuk from 1981 and the novel it's based on, but it breaks golden rules of being a sequel, and lacks any connections to it whatsoever, also, its aura is just... NO!!!! Gát György just denies the truth when told to him, and avoids any form of punishments. He is actually Video the Brinquedo of Hungary, just worse. My judgment to this movie is: Please, remove any claims that it's a sequel, and replace all of them with the Ripoff and Mockbuster labels. Because Kis Vuk is more like Ratatoing to Ratatouille. A cursed copycat who borough shame not only to Hungary, but to PLANET EARTH and all lifeforms inhabiting it. Seriously.
In only one word: Stupid Worst animation ever seen. Worst voice acting too. I cannot imagine a movie worse then this. Nothing to see. It's not funny. It's pathetic. It's a bad joke. They should look for another job. I cant't understand who was stupid enough to actually put money into this cr*p. DO NOT WATCH THIS. WATCH THE ORIGINAL "VUK". It's a sh*t. At all.5 000 000 is very high budget in Hungary. It's a waste of money. Incredible.The only reason you'd be watching this is to get a good taste of how a movie can be awful!!!!
This is a butchery of one of the best hungarian cartoon ever made. I don't know what the directors smoke to think this .... thing will be successful, but it makes me feel shameful and unclean. I mean everything that can be wrong with a movie it's in this abomination. The graphics, the camera, the story, everything... The original Vuk was beloved by many people, everyone i asked knows what vuk is, and they say it's a good cartoon, they love it, it's part of their childhood. When I start to talk about ... this they say "Omg. Anything but that". There is a saying: "if it's not broke, don't fix it" or at least don't ruin it with a sequel. Definitely not recommended by me, far from it.
This movie is "based" off an old Hungarian kid's film called Vuk, which as massively popular, and it really doesn't show. Whilst I've only watched a few minutes of the original movie, I can say with 100% certainty that they are unrelated aside from their names. This is apparently because Atilla Dargay didn't want the creators ruining his original film. That was certainly an averted crisis.So, if it is completely unrelated, why does it exist? The answer is that sweet, sweet Forint. There is no other reason.The movie itself is laughably bad. It looks like the visual manifestation of the Crazy Bus theme. The sad thing is, the concept art looks better than the original movie.The voice-acting varies, and ranges from KILL ME NOW to mediocre. Freddie Highmore, better known for playing CHARLIE BUCKET in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, does an obnoxious voice for his role in the movie.The plot is frankly boring and deserves no recognition.Avoid unless you like bad movies. An absolute waste of Hungarian money.-5/7, So Bad, It's Perfect.
Many people believe Foodfight! to be the worst CGI film of all time, but they are mistaken. There is a film out there, with less realistic character animation and with a genuinely much worse plot and writing. This is it. The utterly flippant attitude it has to disability is astounding, the rapping somehow feels more out of place than in Titanic: The Legend Goes On and some of the voice-acting could be replicated by getting drunk and trying to impersonate Mr Freeze from Batman and Robin. Everyone, watch this car-crash if you get the chance. It is one of the most inadvertently hilarious films ever made.
A Fox's Tale is probably the worst animation film I have seen this year, The cover looked like a interesting children's film so I picked it up at my local store for my younger cousin, No wonder why it was in the bargain bin A Fox's Tale has low-budget animation that looks absolutely terrible, I felt like I was having a seizure while watching this crap. Animation of the characters is unnatural and nausea inducing, The scenery looks like puke and the plot is so predictable. I don't suggest this movie at all!
This is a disgrace. You could say that this is the worst animated movie ever made (which is true), or that how this cinematic atrocity gives the original Vuk a bad name (which is also true), but honestly I'm a little bit happy, because after this colossal disgrace, no one will ever try to touch the Vuk brand. Moreover, it will cease to exist as a brand, and that's fine, for we don't need any more cynical, money hungry psychopaths messing around with our childhood memories. Let's toss our collective rotten tomatoe (khm...) to their face and let them rot with it!
Back in 1984, the folks who went on to create Pixar brought out their first short film, "André and Wally B. ". Its use of CGI was amazing for its day and it led to great things...at least for Pixar. In contrast, "A Fox's Tale" came out in 2008...and looked pretty similar in CGI quality to "André and Wally B."--which is appalling, as by 2008 CGI had improved exponentially and films like "Ratatouille" and "WALL-E" were the new norm. Yet, inexplicably, "A Fox's Tale" looks decades old and is just an incredibly cheap and ugly film.This cheapness and ugliness of "A Fox's Tale" is exactly why it ended up on IMDB's old Bottom 100 list--the 100 lowest rated films on the website. However, the criteria for the list recently changed...and films required at least 10,000 votes to make the list....and "A Fox's Tale" only currently has about 8300 votes. Now a few years ago, I tried to find this film because I was trying to see as many of the old Bottom 100 as I could...and only recently has the film come to YouTube...so better late than never. Or, perhaps not.So despite having very dated CGI, is the film worth seeing? No. The main problem is that the CGI is so ugly that watching it is a real chore. An ugly short film is bad enough...but in this case you have 85 minutes of eye-bleedingly ugly animation. Frankly, stick figures or sock puppets would have looked better! Then, when you add insipid songs, a story that is terrible and dead-looking humans that move like robots, it's a recipe for disaster...both for kids as well as adults. In fact, if I ever bought a copy of the film, it would be to use as punishment if my kids were bad...very, very, VERY bad!!So is this the ugliest and most worthless CGI film I've ever seen? Well, that's tough call, as the standard of pure ugliness and awfulness is very low with films like "Foodfight!" also making this old Bottom 100 list. Suffice to say that it's about as bad as "Foodfight!" and is worthless in every possible way. An abysmal mess of a film that is so bad you have to see it to believe it! I score it 1 simply because IMDB doesn't allow 0.Pretty good computer animation for 1984...but it came out in 2008!
