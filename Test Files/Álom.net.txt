Even though I heard from many independent and reliable sources that this movie is bad, nay, one of the worst high-budget films ever made, I was skeptical. I have now watched it and can confirm it as one of the all-time low of international filmmaking. A drama without a single trace of suspense or excitement, a love story without a single romantic line, a teen comedy with very few traces of very trite and embarrassing humor, this movie is a MUST. Without having seen it, one will forever lack the experience of a truly, authentically, genuinely bad film.The only mystery that remains is who on earth sponsored this celluloid waste and what on earth made some of Hungary's prominent comic actors (notably Gábor Reviczky) subscribe to it.To sum up: the trite and/or hilariously out-of-place dialogs, the embarrassing discontinuities, and the sub-YouTube-dilettante quality of acting and directing make it difficult to believe that this movie was ever meant to be taken seriously to any degree, but the lack of even the slightest trace of irony leaves one with no other option than to assume that it was.
In only one word: StupidThe longer review: From the very beginning you know you're watching a bad movie. You know it, you feel it, you know you're guilty, but you can't stop watching it, because you feel it can't be worse. But it can. It can make the story shallow in every minute. The conversations are simply stupid, the "actors" are just moving through the camera and showing their asses (great asses thou) and the worst, they think they have to act like this... A must watch I have to admit. But it's not good, not even bad, it's the most awful piece of crap you can imagine. Watch this, enjoy the guilty pleasure, but please, have your right sense and admit: It should have never been made.
This movie is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Hungarian movies are generally bad and boring, but this one tops them all. Every aspect of the movie is amateurish. The acting is horrible, the story is stupid and the whole concept of cheerleaders in Hungary is just ridiculous. The only reason to watch this garbage is to see some hot chicks, but be warned, their lack of acting will turn you off very quickly. The whole movie is an embarrassment for everybody involved. THe main character played by Lilla Labancz. She is the worst of the "actresses" and makes me wonder what it takes nowadays to get a lead role in Hungarian theatre.
Best movie I have ever seen. Literally, pure cinematic greateness.
It's like a 13 years old boy's fantasy without any plotline or sensible dialogue and without the adult content. The dialogues are idiotic, the whole plot is as well, with a lot of takes on boobs and ass. It was so bad I could finish in about five attempts and - after years of frequent imdb usage - I registered only to write a critique about it. So there it is.
You 'll like this movie, but before you have to remove your brain. I did not see the movie just a critic, but that was enough to know that this movie is just a joke. Now I watched the trailer and it's primitive like the movie. It wants to compensate the low level of the movie with boobs and asses. I t represents the woman as selfish, superficial, dumb and bitchy. Horrible actors and director. It's a shame for the movie industry and for Hungary too. The other rating with 10 stars must be somebody from the movie staff. I wouldn't wonder. All in all I wouldn't recommend to spend money and time to watch this. I would wonder if this movie made some profit.
The worst film in the Hungarian film industry. Weak story, poor performance. Chearleding squad in Hungary? Good joke... The other 10 stars rating came from somebody, who's working in the staff... You can't stop watching it, because you feel it can't be worse. But it can. No one is wasting her/his time for this.
Very bad movie, worse than an average elementary school play. It's simply not worth the time watching it. This is a banal teen movie with very few elements of originality: the rivalry of two teenage girls who in the end manage to work together for the benefit of a greater good. I think the authors took everything bad from the American teen movies, chewed it and spat it out. And this is how "Alom.net" came into being. The story is told in a poor language and the poorest possible performance of the actors, maybe with the exception of Rékasi Károly and Reviczky Gábor. However their skills and experience are simply not enough to save the film. The worst is the lead actress, Labancz Lilla. I don't think she belongs to the guild of actors. She is very beautiful, extremely lovely but with very little acting talent. On the other hand, the whole movie is filled with beautiful wannabe-Barbies, extremely nice looking girls but none of them are above or near average as far as acting skills are concerned. The only edible thing in this picture is the soundtrack and perhaps the setting (it was filmed by the Balaton lake, Hungary)
Well, what can I add that hasn't been said before... other than, if you love bad movies or ones with cult following, the names of Roger Corman and Godfrey Ho will be familiar.If anyone gets the chance to watch this, be aware, that neither Corman nor Ho was involved, but definitely inspired the filmmakers. So, there was this movie, where they needed actors who look nice on screen, and in that sense the movie delivers. The reason I gave this 3 stars is because from a technical aspect, the movie is watchable, the mute button exists for a reason.Anyhow, since Hungary is a small country, that has more celebrities, than a retainer of soap opera level beauty actors, the choice was made to give it the Ho treatment, and dub the actors over. I mentioned soap opera for a reason because the young voice actors and actresses do dub soap operas, high profile movies and video games. Imagine like having Scarlett Johansson lip sync to the voice of Idina Menzel, it's the level of how easily you recognize, who's on screen, and who's actually speaking. In other words, this movie felt like a failed Dawson's Creek or One Tree Hill pilot, where in addition of seeing butts and boobs we've also got the bonus dubbing voices at the ready.Speaking of dubbing, whereas Mr. Reviczky is completely unknown beyond his home country and foreign theater circles, he voices Robert De Niro in localization, which makes this a different take on the Rocky and Bullwinkle movie if they were measured in embarrassment.
It is not the greatest film but the women are super thin and hard bodies. Are all the reviews by fat, er I mean curvy, women?? Seriously. This is better than Disney Star Wars and made me laugh.
Don't listen to these other comments because they don't know what true cinema is! i thought this movie was great from the start. its a attention grabber but it gets a little cheesy for 10 minutes of the movie but after that it gets so funny!!! a must watch!if you watch Paris Hiltons movies these are nothing like that. this movie is sweet and fun for the whole family. Lilla Labanc is an amazing actress. Gábor Forgács could win an Oscar if this was a drama. i will definitely watch this again. if you watched movies like Savaing Silverman, Half Baked, Clerks, and Dumb and Dumber... this movie is up there with them. seriously.
