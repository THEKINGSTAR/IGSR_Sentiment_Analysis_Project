*Disclaimer: I only watched this movie as a conditional agreement. And I see films for free. I wouldn't be caught dead giving my hard earned money to these idiots.Well, to explain the depth of this 'film', I could write my shortest review, ever. Don't see this movie. It is by far the stupidest, lamest, most lazy, and unbelievably UNFUNNY movie I have ever seen. It is a total disaster. But since my hatred for this movie, and the others like it, extends far beyond one viewing, I think I'll go on for a bit.I don't know any of the people in the movie besides Carmen Electra, Vanessa Minnillo, and Kim Kardashian, but it doesn't matter. They're all horrible, though I think that was the point. The editing is flat out horrible, and possibly blatant continuity errors make this crapfast even crappier than I thought it would be. Now I know that these films are not supposed to be serious at all, but come on, it's film-making 101 that if someone gets a minor facial cut, it should be there in the next shot. AND, if someone gets cut by a sword, there should be blood and at least a cut (though since the Narnia films "get away with it", I'll give Disaster Movie a pass here).The 'jokes' are thoughtless and mindless physical gags that obviously take after some of the most popular movies of the last year (there's some from late 2007 as well, including 2 of our 5 Best Picture nominees).You know what the saddest thing about these stupid movies are? I don't care how much money they make, or how many cameos they have, these sorry ass excuses for films are taking away jobs from actors, writers, and directors that truly deserve the attention. Lionsgate, I thought you had better taste than this. You should be ashamed of yourselves for making this kind of crap. And as for Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer? Burn in hell. You guys are contributing to the decline of western civilization. Correction...you are the CAUSE of the downfall of western civilization.
I am writing this in hopes that this gets put over the previous review of this "film". How anyone can find this slop entertaining is completely beyond me. First of all a spoof film entitled "Disaster Movie", should indeed be a spoof on disaster films. Now I have seen 1 (yes count them, 1) disaster film being spoofed, that being "Twister". How does Juno, Iron Man, Batman, The Hulk, Alvin and the Chipmunks, Amy Winehouse, or Hancock register as Disaster films? Selzterwater and Failburg once again have shown that they lack any sort of writing skill and humor. Having unfortunately been tortured with Date Movie and Epic Movie I know exactly what to expect from these two...no plot, no jokes just bad references and cheaply remade scenes from other films. Someone should have informed them that satire is more than just copy and paste from one film to another, though I shouldn't say that because some of these actually just seem to be taken from trailers.There is nothing clever or witty or remotely smart about the way these two write, and I can't believe that some people still pay to see these travesties. It's an insult to the audience, though if they enjoy these films I doubt that they are smart enough to realize that.Rating: Unfortunately there is not a number low enough (yes this includes negatives) to rate this. This deserves to be in the top 5 worst films of all time, right there with Date Movie, Epic Faliure...I mean movie, and Meet the Spartans. I would rather be forced into a 24 hour "Manos: The Hands of Fate" marathon than watch this slop.
Really, I could write a scathing review of this turd sandwich, but instead, I'm just going to be making a few observations and points I've deduced.There's just no point in watching these movies anymore. Does any reader out there remember Scary Movie? Remember how it was original with a few comedic elements to it? There was slapstick, some funny lines, it was a pretty forgettable comedy, but it was worth the price of admission. Well, That was the last time this premise was funny. STOP MAKING THESE MOVIES. PLEASE.I could call for a boycott of these pieces of monkey sh*t, but we all know there's going to be a line up of pre pubescent annoying little buggers, spouting crappy one liners like, "THIS IS SPARTA!" and, "IM RICK JAMES BITCH" so these movies will continue to make some form of monetary gain, considering the production value of this movie looks like it cost about 10 cents to make.Don't see this movie. Don't spend any money on it. Go home, rent Airplane, laugh your ass off, and then silently judge the people that are talking about this movie on Monday. Do yourself a favor.
If you saw the other previous spoof movies by these two horrible gentlemen, then you should know that this already will be bad. I'll tell you the truth, if you want to watch it as a brainless person (ironically meant for the stereotypical teenagers, which I am not) then you will laugh at it a bit. But if you judge it, even a little, the movie automatically fails. Why? Never ask that when it comes to these two men.Remember the good old Hollywood days whenever making a movie was about showing people a type of art, and also a story that kept you on the edge of your seat? Well whenever word hit that making films earned you loads of cash, then all these greedy people came in the picture and its quite pathetic. These two are no exception. We still have movie artists (most notably the genius that is Christopher Nolan). But these two guys just...well I've been writing so big words, let me put it in simple terms for these guys...These guys suck, they are not artists, but instead money craving whores. And their latest movie proves this even more so.The movie fails so easily its mind blowing. I mean nothing was funny in the trailer, and people usually put the best stuff in them (like idiots sometimes).I knew it was going to be bad, but I made a bet with my "friends" and that wasn't a good idea at all. I have to write movie reviews in a paper and tell everyone whats good and whats bad, same for my friends. We flipped on who has to review it...Why me? Well I'm warning you at least. It shouldn't even be called a movie, nothing about it is artistic or original. The jokes..I'm sorry, the references are made throughout at pretty much random, like the Hannah Montana or the Juno gig (they were actually close to spoofing it, but failed by referencing instead of joking and twisting it).Oh and please, the random wrestling scene? I don't know about you other guys, but I have high respect for women, and I have a high respect for film-making. What I do know is you shouldn't have something in a movie that doesn't add up to the story or anything. Nudity is not really needed (Titanic was the closest exception, but still you would've gotten the idea if you only saw her bare legs.) Now I hate it when a girl says all guys are the same, perverts and brainless (and if you disagree with what I said about the nudity in a film, you might be one of them unless you actually believe it has a point), and sadly this film just makes that stereotype a little bigger. Thats if anyone watches it, which hahahaha!!! By the way, when I said movies should have scenes and only scenes that add up to the main plot, that was the ticket right there to say that this movie fails. Yup, just like that. Perhaps I'm grading too hard for these guys. I mean its a brainless movie...Nope, they deserve it. Besides thats the best part about reviewing a bad movie, you get to rip it inside out. Thats if you know how to grade a movie correctly.But lastly (well I've got about 4 scores worth of bad movies I need to write about, but whatever) the main idea about spoofing was brand new when Airplane! came out. Same with Naked Gun. And whenever something random came into play, the story was still progressing. For example, the arrow in Airplane! shooting out of nowhere: random, yes, but the story was still movie and no one was distracted except the audience. Perfect. Naked Gun, not only was it spoofing cop films and others, but it also had its own jokes. Same with Airplane! Anyways this movie was made for money, not to tell people a story. Simple as that, and never flip a dang coin to determine something that could be life threatening.I give it a 1 out of a 10. Just do yourself a favor and watch good movies, or mediocre for that matter.
This movie I saw a day early for free and I still feel like I got ripped off. It is totally brain dead. Burping, kicking in the groin and boobs all over the place. Lame. What is wrong with society, that films like this even get made? The parodies were all horrendous, and un-funny. The plot was lackluster at best and the acting was shallow, transparent and really quite unnecessary.Anyone see "Idiocracy"? Remember the movie that won all the academy awards in the future? Well this is that movie. I have not seen a more rancid crappy film. "Date Movie" was okay, The Scary movies at least had decent plots, but this, this makes "spoofs" (if I can be so nice to call it that) for this year 0 for 3, with "Meet the Spartans" and "Superhero Movie" all falling flat.Well I've wasted even more of my life typing about this sack of cow dung. So all in all, don't see this movie, unless of course your IQ is below 80.Thanks, R
Honestly, what is wrong with you, Hollywood? Not only is this the WORST thing that has happened to you ---- you keep funding these "cheesy writers of Scary Movie" to make these movies. I mean, come on Carmen Electra, you know even better than them that you have potential! Stop portraying in parody movies! See, I can't believe I am comparing "parody" to this movie. This movie has no "parody" or "comedy" in it, this is all referencing. All they need to do is see a movie title, take a line and a scene from a trailer, and turn it into a script. Never in my LIFE have I ever been so ticked off by you (Hollywood).I mean, Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg, you don't even care for the money, you just want to prove you can be a film-maker too, but that's not the point! Movies are something you should enjoy, and this... this is making bland jokes and pointless (as I may say "comedy) with fart jokes and people being hit with objects... or just getting hurt (but you realize that they are okay)?Now please, STOP! You're ruining the name of "parody" and you are causing people to hate you even more!Please, as a warning, DO NOT WATCH THIS.
I was given a free ticket to this film; so I can't complain that I was ripped off (except in that some 90 minutes of my life were irretrievably stolen from me). These sort of movies (Date Movie, Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans) haven't been funny for some time now but "Disaster Movie" has reached a new low. There wasn't one real laugh anywhere in the film, and most of the alleged "jokes" were actually painful. (There was a considerable amount of childish, mean-spirited stuff in the form of racist, sexist, and especially homophobic, garbage present, along with ample helpings of juvenile gross-outs.) None of the actors were even bothering to put up any pretense of acting. There is nothing hip, clever, or even mildly intelligent going on here. The entire film is from beginning to end crass, vulgar, irrational, and utterly humorless in any human sense. I know that in the past these sort of trash has made enough money to keep Seltzer et al., grinding them out but "Disaster Movie" may just be the downfall of the franchise. The utter contempt that Seltzer and his collaborators have for their audience is finally beginning to show through clearly. If this one fails (and from what I saw in the almost empty theater there is a good chance of it), Seltzer will have to go back to the drawing board, stop making these lazy catastrophes, and finally develop a real sense of humor. This movie is an unfunny piece of puke - stay away from it.
OK, so "Disastrous" isn't an imaginative barb for this movie, but then there's not a shred of wit to the movie, so....I saw this movie for free. A friend who said he "pissed his pants" at the trailer had free passes. I think he's incontinent.A spoof of disaster movies might have been fun. This is not it. A couple disaster movies get referenced, not really spoofed. Instead, the "spoofing" is of recent movies of all genres, and of aspects of current pop-culture. Then again, how current is women's wrestling or the "Head On" commercials?If there's anything about it that's good, there's the 70 minute or so running time (where did they get 90 minutes?) and Nicole Parker seems like she might be good, if she had good material.
Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, the way everyone talks about these guys are as if they are on America's Most Wanted List, boy there is a lot of hate before the release date of Disaster Movie. They have brought us the "stupid" comedies like Date Movie, Epic Movie, and Meet the Spartans, pretty much all those movies have had the same hate, I can understand why. Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are like the kids in high school who just cruised by, just failing every class possible, being happy with the C's and D's, then they somehow get into Princeton because their parents had money or something, it's the exact same thing with movies. The way that I just happen to look at these movies is that they are like a MAD TV spoof, just mindless entertainment. I hated Date Movie, didn't mind Epic Movie, liked Meet the Spartans, Disaster Movie is a notch lower than Meet the Spartans. We have recycled jokes from the guy's previous movies, jokes that drag on and on to the point where you'll tear your hair out, and is of course, made badly.Will has had a dream that he feels like the end of the world is coming. All of a sudden the city is attacked Cloverfield style, he and his friends run around trying to find shelter and figure out what is going on while bumping into one celebrity after another. But even Batman, Iron Man, The Hulk, and Hancock can not save this world. Will and his friends realize that they have to save the world on their own and fight evil chipmunks, aliens, and flying cows.Disaster Movie, actually does have a couple laughs, I will admit that, I nearly died laughing during the Alvin and the Chipmunks parody, it was so badly funny, I just couldn't help but laugh. There are just some fun moments, I think it's ridicules that some people can not admit that. That's the reason for my title is because I saw a lot of comments from users that didn't even involve them seeing the movie, they were just complaining... this isn't the IMDb that I know, it's silly that people are just putting on comments that have nothing to do with their opinion on why they hate the movie before they even see it. Back onto the movie, my main thing that I'm upset with, this movie didn't need a script, it seems as if Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer just made it up as they went along. For some reason we have movies that were literally just released last month like Wanted and Hancock, not to mention The Dark Knight. I think they just coursed their way through this, while the movie has some funny moments, my HONEST opinion, if you want to see this I suggest the rental, this is straight to DVD quality.1/10
"The human race has one really effective weapon, and that is laughter."-Mark TwainI am not sure when it became OK to keep making movies that virtually no one goes to see, but in the case of the recent plethora of spoof films I for one am glad that they continue.Now I know a lot of people out there cannot even fathom why people would enjoy such stupidity, but that is just it, you don't need to understand, sometimes people should just let go and be stupid.Stupid is the perfect word to describe "Disaster Movie" actually no matter how many times you say the word stupid, it would never be enough to justify just how stupid it is. But for me I absolutely love these stupid spoof movies.The "story", and I use this word very lightly, gives us Will, who is right in the middle of his Super Duper Sweeet Sixteen (even though he is actually 25) when the world starts coming under attack, from mostly meteorites, and tornado's, and earthquakes. Loosley following the "Cloverfeild" plot, Will must reach his girlfriend who is trapped in the Museum where she works.But does he have to do this alone? Of course not, there are plenty of stupid characters and even stupider obstacles that he must overcome.By far the best spoof on a character here is Juno, played by Crista Flannigan, who has done this before on Mad TV I think, she had me rolling on the floor more than anyone. Second to her is Nicole Parker, who is hilarious as Amy Winehouse, Jessica Simpson, but most of all the princess from Enchanted. Who is not actually a princess but a drugged out homeless chick, F-ing hilarious.Of course no movie is safe, everything from the past year gets made fun off, from Indiana Jones, all the way to Step Up. Most are funny some are really stupid.The one bad thing that I have to say, is that some of the Spoofs lasted way longer than they needed to, it should be spoof, spoof, spoof, story advance. Only it is Spooooooooof, Spoooooof, story advance. And how many characters does Ike Barenholts need to play, seriously its like they didn't have the budget for more actors. But he was pretty funny.All in all this was really good, definitely better than last years "Meet the Spartans" not as good as "Scary Movie" so I would rank it up there with "Epic Movie" which I thought was also great. If you like stupid, and you are not old enough to see "College" then you should really check this out.
I know its not saying much but this was the best movie that these guys have made.I found that there was a lot less crazy, unnecessary randomness and they put actual thought into their jokes.(there was some random scenes but they were pretty funny IMO) I saw it for free so that may have changed my opinion a bit but all in all i enjoyed this movie even though some of the people left in the middle at the theater i was at.If you haven't liked any of the recent spoof movies ("superhero movie", Meet the Spartans") then I wouldn't recommend this film. But if you did then this is a movie that will certainly entertain you.
First there was DATE MOVIE....then EPIC MOVIE (truly epic)......then MEET THE SPARTANS....and now, ladies and gentlemen, from the guys who brought you the aforementioned comedy classics, comes perhaps their greatest,most inventive and most hilarious work yet, "DISASTER MOVIE".The movie Makes fun of everyone and everything from the teenage **** Hanna Montana, Money-chasing-no-talent-sell-out Will smith's drunken superhero character from "Hancock", the braindead-chickflick Sex in the city", the teenage pregnancy flick "Juno", as well as many other superhero flicks from the past year.You would, like the other movies produced by the same people, need to have seen the movies they are making fun with, in order to find this movie even more funny. This movie is like one big laugh, you can barely catch your breath before the next thing crack you up, you would have to be extremely dull if you do not find this movie the slightest big funny. This twisted form of humor is just so great, and the way things happen in the movie is truly epic, you constantly get surprised of the makers ways of introducing stuff, you just sit back laugh and wonder how the hell did they come up with stuff like that.VERDICT: Hilarious hilarious hilarious movie that I would absolutely recommend to anyone looking for complex and twisted humor.10/10 and a contender for the greatest movie ever made.
No, it's not a Cannes Film Festival official selection, nor will you see it on the roster of Berlin or Venice or San Sebastian, but for all you film critics you are disecting this film as if it was an art house flick, you need to lighten up! Is the movie stupidly dumb, yes...at times, is it incoherent...yup, is it offensive? if you cant appreciate the brand of humor...hmm..yeah probably, but does it do what it was meant to do? Most definitely. I laughed my ass off and I seriously did not know what to expect. Granted I laughed for a lot of different reason. First the set up and akwardness of some of the scenes, the FUNNY MOMENTS, because yes it did have some very funny moments that had me laughing out loud. But all in all I enjoyed the film for what it was. All you film critics here need to get off your high horse and sit back and see it for what it is... brainless entertainment. For me I left my baggage at the door and went for the ride. I left the theatre feeling lighter than when I went it so for me, it did do what it was set out to do.
"Disaster Movie" is great in every aspect, with the script being the crowning achievement. This film excels way beyond the standard of spoof-films set by Mel Brooks. One of the very few things lacking was an appearance by Leslie Nielsen. The movie features non-stop hilarity that will have everyone reeling with laughter for years to come. Walking out of the movie my entire body felt sore from laughing so hard and for so long. I enjoy all the pop culture references and how accurate they were to what they were portraying. The part with Dr. Phil was excellent, and I enjoyed it especially when he got shot. It's hilarious; I cannot emphasize that enough. Take your friends, your family, and even your dog to see this movie. It will provide great memories for many generations to come. Your great grandchildren will purchase this movie on some sort of futuristic movie watching device. This movie is Oscar worthy and FFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCKKK KILL ME I WANT TO DIE.
I saw this at the cinemas last week, and i'm seriously considering going to see it at LEAST 3 more times. It's hilarious! The Princess was my favourite and so was Batman. It was funny all the way through it! So many spoofs. The songs are awesome and the characters are very charming and clever. If you like hilariously funny movies... watch this one. You won't be disappointed. If you are a person who is up to date with Hollywood and the latest movies, you will find this funny and get all the jokes. There are some sad parts but mostly funny. I hope they keep making funny movies like this forever. And Remember... all the most funniest movies end in "movie" like Scary movie, date movie, superhero movie, epic movie, and Disaster movie.
This movie was absolutely incredible. I love the way the juxtaposition in the cinematic technique experience highlighted the portrayal of the fat chicks dignity in such an extraordinarily derogatory manner. i mean this was one the best movies I've ever seen, and that include revenge of the nerds 4. If i wasn't so interested in catching butterflies and using them as chips when i play no limit Texas hold em, then i would quit my day job as a professional scat artist (not the jazz kind) and become the films executive producer, and ensure that this will at least have 4 very similar in storyline sequels. Many thanks, with all my love in devotion. Timothy Michael Parfitt hugs and kisses :) <3
OH common u guys, the movie was damn great and so funny especially the enchanted princess! Nicole parker really is one good impersonator! I loved her role there and she was the very reason why I was entertained. She is so funny and talented. Given the wonderful voice, acting, and looks, I bet she will do greater comedy movies and shows just like on mad TV! Weeeh! Can't wait for another movie like this! ^^ Anyways, for those who hated this movie, please just don't be so rude because there are actually people with different tastes, and who knows they will loved just the way I did?! In my opinion, this is better than meet the spartans & epic movie. I hope to see more Nicole comedy movies! ^^
meet the Spartans was a cheap movie and not fun to watch. so my expectations were very low for disaster movie. i went to the cinema with a friend of mine. we liked the movie a lot actually! i think it has some very strong jokes were you must laugh about. much better than meet the Spartans!!. meet the Spartans was crap!!. epic movie was kinda fun but not as good as disaster movie. i hope this guys keep making movies like these. everyone says that they must stop making this film. when i saw meet the Spartans í said the same, but when i saw disaster movie i want more of this!!!.10/10
come on ppl, this is a dumb comedy movie, u gotta like things like family guy and etc. i hope they never stop making these kind of movies, cuz i will always buy them!!! i love the songs they put in this movie :) and the princess is awesome :) and i loved meet the Spartans as well, I've watched this movie 5 times already and ill keep watching it, if u don't like these kind of movies then stop watching them and move on with ur life and don't badger them cuz u have a horrible taste of movies and wouldn't know a good movie even if it hit u in the face >.< the thought of these movies are to poke fun at the movies that have played that year, which they have done a great job with and shouldn't change what they are doing.
Please read my review before voting up or down on my comment. To give you some background I'm not a huge fan of spoof movies but I have watched a lot of them. Probably the first one being Don't Be a Menace... which was solid. Scary Movie 1 and 2, I thought were funny and enjoyable. Scary Movie 3 was horrid. Scary Movie 4 was a disaster. Epic movie, I'm not even kidding here worst movie ever made. I skipped Date Movie and Meet the Spartans just because I could tell by the previews they would be on the Epic movie level of worst movies. But out of sheer boredom I decide to watch Disaster Movie. It starts off rough, I hate 10000 BC and Amy Winehouse. They spoof pretty much everything from Juno to Alvin and the Chipmunks to Iron Man to Indiana Jones and Kung Fu Panda. There are certainly some questionable scenes that are flat out not funny or just horribly done but whatever I wasn't expecting much going in. But I give it a 10 because everyone else gives it a 1. If you watch Epic Movie and this back to back you will see this deserves a much higher rating, it's also better than the ones I listed up there after Scary Movie 2. I like the singing portions with the kids from high school also because it's funny. It's definitely better than the crap they have been pumping out the last 3-4 years.
