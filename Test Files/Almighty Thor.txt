The simple answer is quite possibly yes. The joke is though that this film is so bad that you can't even laugh at it. I found myself cringing at the appalling dialogue. The CGI was very poorly done and the camera work in general was very dodgy to say the least with lots of shaking.The "acting" (if you can call it that) was appalling. Whether or not this is due to the poor directing or that they are actually that bad (which I fail to believe) is unforgivable, and some might even say criminal. As someone who has done some acting, if I was in this steaming heap, I would want my name removed from the credits.This is defiantly one to avoid if you value your time. It is 1 hour and 30 minutes I will never get back. Even Alan Smithee wouldn't want to put his name to this.
I'm sorry this movie was horrible. From the beginning with the weird cgi of the huge army in battle, but any scenes with the soldiers only showed one or two fighting... Most of the time swinging their swords up in the air to the off camera demon dogs (or whatever)... To the constant walking of Loki once he got to Earth...what was that a total of 10+ minutes of him just strolling on the sidewalk and attempting to look menacing? The movie was so bad i got distracted by Thor's brother's weird Rocky looking lip... and Thor's bright white two front teeth? Are those bad caps or did he suck his thumb too long... Thor whined more than Luke Skywalker in the first Star Wars... I gave up with only 15 minutes left of the movie. Thor even had some "magical" earth jacket that would hide the hammer when he put it in his inside pocket...sometimes it went in handle first some times hammer end first...(Didn't Dungeons and Dragon's have some endless pocket or something like that?) Oh the "magical" jacket even had a place to hold his sword on his back and remained invisible until he pulled it out... :)Btw, I actually registered on IMDb so i could post this review...That's how bad the movie was...
This movie was just hilariously awful. It seems like a 12 year old wrote the script. It tells the story of a young Thor coming of age and trying to avenge his father Odin (played by professional rassler Kevin Nash), who was smited by Loki (Richard Grieco). Seems Loki the evil trickster wants the famous hammer that would eventually become Thor's bread and butter weapon. Grieco walks around with evil written all over him including a powdery white face and black spikey armor.Cody Deal is the dumbest Thor or for that matter any other super hero/god ever. He can't fight and even though Jarnsaxa (a warrior chick trained by The Valkyries played by Patricia Velasquez) tells him over and over that he can't fight, has no skills and can't beat Loki he just continually ignores her and says "I'm going to find Loki and kill him". Guess what?! Every time he finds Loki he gets his butt whipped handily. Still our thickheaded moron of a hero won't go train and says "I am going to find Loki and kill him!" This movie is beyond bad. I watched it on the Sci/Fi channel and it has all the makings of a Sci/Fi original film. The CGI is cheap and cartoony. The fights are shot like they shot one move, cut, then another move, cut and then another. BUT I will say this, if you like bad movies and like to laugh at how horrible and ridiculous they are then you will get something out of this. I laughed and was held to the screen by its awfulness!
It's almost like whoever wrote this doesn't know anything about Thor. With Scifi(I refuse to type the other)pouring money in to garbage like this and canceling great shows they have destroyed the network and it started with wrestling, I don't see ever watching the channel again after the SGU finale.I can't even watch more than 15 min of it and that was painful beyond words, then I thought it to be unfair to say the things like this without at least finishing it so i suffered... So if you want to feel like digging your eyes out with a spoon watch this. Character names were the only thing that had to do with Thor I really wish I could give it negative stars but 1 will have to do.
I have been a Thor fan since the first editions came out when I was a boy. This movie was a horrible adaptation of a great legend. The casting was terrible, the acting bad and the graphics seemed twenty years old. I understand low budget films made for cable, but I could not watch this one. Thor came across as a geek (not misspelled) god instead of the true power he should be. The hammer looked as if were made out of whatever could be found in the back yard. The female lead showed no real athleticism and the fight scenes were poorly choreographed. The movie may have gotten better as it progressed, but after 45 minutes I had to give up on it. All in all, a very disappointing movie that had great possibilities.
I have read other reviews of this film, and think they are being generous to talk about this film as having five characters, because I saw some people wandering around on the screen, sometimes in slo-mo, other times in no-mo, but there wasn't much character there. Cody Deal, who is he, by the way?, has the body for Thor; too bad they kept it covered up most of the time with a Wal-Mart quality costume. He doesn't have the voice for this kind of hero, however, and I kept waiting for him to just stop talking.Richard Grieco has acting skills, which unfortunately he left back in the 1980s and neglected to bring along to this film. The rest can go without mention.As for the plot, well, it is hard to talk about plot here. Thor is supposed to save the world by defeating the evil devil-god Loki in the back alleys of Los Angeles, and every other low-budget location that could be had for a hundred bucks and some coffee-shop coupons. Round this out with computer animations and enhancements straight off of my old Commodore 64 computer, and you get a major horror film, but perhaps not the kind of horror really intended. Someone was channeling Ed Wood here for sure. We just needed burning paper plates doubling as UFOs to complete the effect, and hey, there's an idea for a sequel! Syfy and Asylum were looking to cash in on the bigger Thor picture in theaters now (apparently this Thor auditioned for that role, too; in what universe was that going to happen?) but apparently Brannagh's Thor isn't hammering the crowds, either, in real blockbuster fashion.Well, I guess this is the season for Worse rather than Norse.
I rented this film thinking it was the Natalie Portman release, oh my gosh was I wrong.Caught by Asylum yet again. The most appalling and cheapskate CGI I have ever see, inaccurate story and weak acting, my goodness, what is this production company really all about. The beast fighting where you see slashing at monsters which are off the screen to save CGI efforts are by example simply laughable.Afraid i could not finish this one, I'd seriously recommend you do not waste your precious life's time even verifying the above. And be careful of your title, make sure it is not an Asylum production.
I have made no secret of disliking The Asylum/SyFy's output, there is the odd exception where some films of theirs are tolerable but neither come close to very good/masterpiece status, most are bad and quite a lot bottom of the barrel quality. Almighty Thor belongs in the bottom of the barrel category, and I can only think of about 3 of their films that are worse than this(Titanic II, Alien vs. Hunter and The Apocalypse).Absolutely nothing about Almighty Thor works. The production values are really quite poor. Haphazard editing, some really odd camera angles and some of the most crude CGI effects in any of The Asylum's films. The dialogue is laughable, although a lot of the film from The Asylum/SyFy have this problem the dialogue here really takes the biscuit. Not much effort is seemingly put into the story or characters here, the story is never secure in the pace-some scenes feel rushed(the ending) and others feel pedantic(the middle)- and is never interesting, while the characters are not developed or used well at all and nothing is done to make me engage with them. The acting all round is also appalling, Cody Deal is very uncharismatic and can't act his way out of a paper bag no matter how hard he tried.Overall, not only one of the worst so far of the year and also one of the worst to come from The Asylum. 0/10 Bethany Cox
This damn film.. I have never seen people act so lifeless. The guy that plays Loki should get a damn razzy for his crapness. The story is ridiculous, and a third along the way they step over into the human world. With they I mean Thor, a pathetic excuse for a norse God (as are the other gods, especially Loki. Screw that guy). And some slack woman, a Valkyrie I don't remember the name of. I just love Syfy. It's laughingly bad. I just shake my head and laugh to myself these days.. I no longer get upset at bad quality TV by them, as it is pretty much what you expect anyway. 1/10 Absolutely laughably bad
Lacking in any merit whatsoever, even as a spoof. This is my only review so far and considering how much of a couch potato I am at the moment, it's a measure of how truly awful this film was that I've made this effort. I thought that I could laugh at/with almost anything. This film is so far from my almost universal sense of humour and tolerance for low standards that you'd need a telescope to see it ... utterly dreadful. I didn't even realise that it was a spoof until googling it a few minutes ago and even then can't believe that the critic found it in any way creditable at all.It only needs to have a passing acquaintance with the source material so I really don't have a problem with that. I can also accept relatively poor acting. Even if this was negligently acted on purpose, it was indeed poorly executed. In fact, I initially thought that this was a poorly dubbed foreign film.It didn't flow, was poorly edited, and had special effects that the original series of Dr. Who would have been ashamed of. OK, that's an exaggeration, but considering current levels of technology this film's makers have proved far less able to utilise the technology available. The script/dialogue had me doing so many cartoon double takes that I felt like my neck would snap. I'm not going to dignify the film by providing a plot line ... I wouldn't want my synopsis to accidentally entice someone to watch the film.I can honestly say that I only continued watching because I couldn't believe it to be so inept. I fell asleep at one point and had to reverse in order not to miss any of the fatigue inducing experience at all ... I want to be able to say that I managed to watch all of it. This is probably not the worst film ever made, but it's certainly the worst I've ever watched. Feel free to try it out but it's not worth your time and I certainly hope no-one paid any money to watch it. Even as a spoof, it's a complete waste of minutes of your life. I need a shower now just to wash the experience away. I'd seek memory loss but then I'd run the risk of accidentally watching it again.
Almighty Thor. The names are the same but everything else has apparently been changed to protect other talented productions regarding anything having to do with the Thunder God. DISCLAIMER: This review is under the label IMHO (In My Humble Opinion)! This production even makes The episode of the Hulk (meets Thor) look good! Save your time. Save you frustration.This show was like very bad sci-fi television. It is hard to believe it is so bad considering the took a whole 12 DAYS to shoot it!!! (Heavy on the sarcasm) Sorry, but it was poorly edited - long dragged out scenes short have been cut tighter. The acting, to me was unconvincing. The final impression was that the movie was misconceived. To much irrelevant "action". Too many long winded speeches. I was excited to see the hot chick from The Mummy (Patricia Velasquez) but her performance was dragged down my other cast (*ahem* Cody Deal)and terrible script and poor direction. One reason I say terrible is because it really failed to hold my attention at all. It truly came across as a rushed botched effort. But I may not know of what I speak, so if you have the time to waste, be my guest.
I made an account just to say how awful this movie is. Kevin Nash wasted his time on this movie. The actors all looked terrible and did not fit the characters they attempted to portray. Whoever made this movie should be quite embarrassed. It makes me ask the question, what was the budget? Seems like a VERY small one. Even for the type of movie it is, it was bad. My opinion of it was very low before I even started watching it, but WOW! It surprised me, that's how bad it was to be honest. Even the CGI disappointed me, and I gave up watching as soon as I realised that the 10 minutes they were using to make Loki look scary... completely failed. (1/10)/10.
Hard to believe this ever saw commercial release. I have seen better films from school projects. The CGI was pretty poor, but that would be forgivable if the story and acting were even passable. The writing was so poor I was putting words in the actors mouths and there were dozens of moments when a simple one-liner would have given the moment a bit of humour or irony. Instead the actors often gazed blankly at the camera with some sort of expression that looked like they were trying to convey some deep emotion, unfortunately it usually looked like they were trying to remember their lines or had some kind of stomach ailment. Possibly not entirely the actors fault, the script and directing were awful and the editing could be largely to blame as it looked like out-takes were left in to pad out the film. Definitely one of the worst films I have ever seen.
I'll be honest - I can see why this film has the IMDB rating and user review hatred that it does, this is a stinker! If Marvel's Thor is the pinnacle of what is right, this version of Thor is a somebody doing cosplay using only items found in a small charity shop as the props and costume. The casting is horrible - c'mon Kevin Nash - I loved you as a wrestler but you couldn't act in the ring and you shouldn't be acting in a film. Richard Grieco is Loki, which was upsetting - his was probably one of the better performances, however I've still seen human statues more animated. Cody Deal - what was the deal, Thor - c'mon really - you come across like a brainless halfwit!? Don't even get me started on Patricia Velasquez - what was that about!?Loki attacks Asgard because he's jealous that Thor could soon be ruler. Loki kills Odin and others. Odin sends Thor's hammer to Earth. Thor goes in search with Jarnsaxa to find it before Loki can. With what feels like no plot, no acting skills, no structure to the film, and no - well, just no hope!This really has to be the worst film I have seen this year and I pride myself on watching terrible films. I regret watching this.1 out of 10.
The acting was Terrible and the cast was not right! so low budget I think they did the whole movie on one hill in the Hollywood hills. and one back ally."CODY DEAL" Has my vote for the worst Actor of all time. He looked Dazed & Confused. Confused Cody Deal looked down and to the left as he did not know his lines and he did not know how to express himself which caused a confusing Dreamscape. The whole movie was a slap in the face to the original movie "Thor" in which Cody Deal auditioned for and did not get it. Then Cody Deal and his gay friends decided to make their own version of the Thor. which they shouldn't of. If your high and drunk and want to get your buddies together for a good laugh then yes this is your movie for a few minutes. #CodyDeal #CodyDealTheWorstActorOfAllTime #CODYDEAL #CODYDEALTheWorstActorOfAllTime
The special effects and acting are bad, so is the plot.
Wow almighty I think not. I saw the ads playing on TV and it actually looked like it might be some harmless, no-brainer fun. Terrible, but fun. Well it was a no-brainer. As this limited made-for-TV Scy-fy feature (from The Global Asylum productions) was a lousy superhero knock-off with little in way of entertainment and even unintentional laughs in this role-playing venture. It reminded me of those Hercules / Xena TV episodes, but they were better. Other than Cody Deal's humorously awkward delivery of his lines and overall whiny attitude as Thor, this mockery was rather drab and repetitive. How many times do I have to watch Richard Grieco as the demonic god Loki wandering around the woods and streets. At least with that wandering, he did look badass in his get-up while also frowning a lot but at least there was a purpose for that constant wandering in search of Odin's Hammer of Invincibility. So there's a lot of walking (bad guys), then running (good guys) and but also yelling. I don't know why but yelling seems like the only way to get something across. Especially Thor. Constant arguments with Patricia Velasquez'z helpful character. But even when danger is around (dogs of hell and the CGI) or there's a chance to finish things off, people decide to stand around explaining things that just don't need explaining. Maybe it's because Thor is just so stupid, you just wish Locki would finish the job "Not quite!". When it comes to the jerky action, for most part it's done in awesome slow-motion to simply enhance the epic, if lumbering fight choreography. It's no effect, they are virtually fighting in slow motion. One move after another. While watch round after round as Thor gets beaten up by Locki. Every encounter is basically the same and Thor is too dumb to realise training would help. But no he must kill Loki NOW! Quite awe-inspiring, just like the powerful dialogues with a message at heart. However where is else to you get to see Thor toting a machine gun yep a machine gun against a god and he did have the hammer at his use. It figures, as its lack of imagination shows. Also showing up in a small part is Kevin Nash as Odin."I don't believe in fate."
First of all I have to mention two things. First of all, I am part Danish and part Norwegian so the Norse mythology is in my heritage and in my blood. Secondly, I can't claim to be overly much fan of the Marvel "Thor" movie neither.But this SyFy Channel attempt to swing at the Norse mythology was just painful and offensive. Given it being a SyFy Channel production gives it a certain degree of leniency, because they usually put out some rather questionable movies. Though it should be said that once in a rare while they do hit a home-run and put out something worthwhile. However, "Almighty Thor" was definitely a swing and a miss of the worst kind.As with most SyFy Channel productions the CGI is questionable or downright laughable. And they didn't fail on that aspect in "Almighty Thor". The CGI animated creatures were such an eyesore and the special effects, with ironic emphasis on special, were nothing to write home about.I could understand the poor attempt at a storyline here, despite the obvious holes and mistakes, but their choice in who were on the cast list. Wow! That just simply puzzles me beyond comprehension. I am sure that Cody Deal (playing Thor) is good at whatever he has made prior to and after "Almighty Thor" (though I can't claim to have seen him before or since), but as the god of thunder, he was just not the best of choices. I couldn't take him seriously in the role; it was like watching a buffed version of Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder) just with a better haircut. And as for Richard Grieco (playing Loki), what was up with that make-up? He looked like he was a methamfetamine addict, and it was difficult to take him serious in the role as well. Then to further upset the scale, enter Patricia Velasquez (playing Jarnsaxa) with that heavy Latin accent, it just didn't fit into the movie at all.Now, "Almighty Thor" isn't all bad. Believe it or not, there was some upsides to the movie. And that was the costumes. I enjoyed the armor and costumes that they used in the movie. Lots of nice details there.In overall, watching "Almighty Thor" was like watching a group of people running around acting out a LARP (Live Action Role Playing) event. It was just dreadful, and a major slap in the face to anyone who respects or pays tribute to the Norse pantheon.Come to think of it, I think they actually got the title wrong, I think it was meant to be titled "Almighty Bore" and not "Almighty Thor". Sure seemed that way from the lack of energy and entertainment value to this production.I've seen a heap of SyFy Channel productions over the years, and this was definitely amongst the top of the chain as in terms of being bad!
I caught this on Syfy, and I wish I could make them take it back. The plot centered around Loki trying to destroy the earth by killing Yggdrasill, the tree of life. I don't remember if either Thor or Loki mention it by name; I got the impression they couldn't pronounce actual Nordic terms if their paychecks depended on it. Not only this, but Loki keeps talking about Ragnarok, and it is obvious the writers had no idea what the term means. They would probably also call people in a blimp "the Rapture." Anywhoo, the whole plot requires Loki to steal Thor's hammer. Why this is difficult is never made clear, because Thor is a major beefcake meathead. He sounds like a surfer and spends most of the movie looking like he needs a diaper change. Some woman named Jarnsaxa spoon-feeds him every move, which is amazing because she is practically unintelligible--a fact made even more painful when they do vocal effects and her words could not be deciphered even by CIA software.I won't spoil the ending, because the director and writer already did that. Suffice it to say that it involves a trip to Hell; not HEL, the Nordic afterlife and the goddess thereof, but basically the Christian Hell--fire, lava, the whole ball of melting wax.Watch this if you need a good laugh; there isn't an ounce of real heroism or grandeur in the whole mess. My biggest disappointment was Richard Grieco, who can be an effective menace but here comes across as a street punk with a wand and a skin condition.
Starring: Richard Grieco,Kevin Nash and Patricia Velasquez. This film was on SyFy Channel as a premiere before its DVD release. Richard Grieco steals the movie as LOKI and really never gives it back,But for a few scenes when others shine. Patricia is Red Sonja-like,She has some nice swordplay and maybe the most dialogue. Kevin Nash as Odin,Has some brief stronger than strong early spots and then dies. Cody Deal as Thor,Is good and heroicCody comes off like young introduction to all the history that is MARVELous. The monsters that Loki/Greico conjures are most impressive and can do some damage on screen to our heroes and humans alike. The director of photography needs to take a bow,Some scenes were lit and atmospheric as anything produced by anyone,No matter the studio. Scenes of destruction from half a dozen Asylum films stock footage,Tsk-tsk.
