Please don't confuse my 1 star rating with 1 star. It is actually 0.
Thank you.
Awkward, unfunny and a painful reminder that modern networks are completely out of touch.
TV execs probably thought this was the woke thing to do big mistake. Everything on the show seems forced... the monologue makes little to no sense and the grunts and sounds she makes is to what.. help build up the joke. Waste of time of a show.
I grew up watching Lilly aka Superwomen, I think I was one of her first couple thousand followers on YouTube. So when she announced she was going to have her own show, I was ecstatic for her because we all know how hard she worked to get here. She deserves it. But after watching one episode, I'm just disappointed. Truly disappointed. I got bored 2 min in, the jokes are borderline lame and cringeworthy and just sound racist at times (& I'm not one to say that lightly). I'm just sad because she has this amazing opportunity to reach out to young people on this platform but instead she choices to victimize herself half of the time. It's not even funny. I truly don't think the show will last. I live in Seattle, WA and everyone I know around me thinks the same. If her content doesn't change and FAST, she's going to be done pretty fast.
A complete show on bashing white people. Oh wow! How original so much fun at every white persons expense but it's okay right? Disgusting. She's weak and does not have an original funny joke to save her life. She is the joke.
I couldn't sit through the entire thing. I didn't laugh once. We don't need a racist from Canada trying to act like she understands America. Not sure why the whole script was the same joke over and over and over. Who wrote this?
The many fault of this show is talent.  Late night isn't missing a bisexual Indian women, with the exception of A small few its missing talent, and Lilly is the bottom of the barrel.
White people = bad
men = bad
women = good
brown people = goodOh, and if you're in doubt that she is bisexual after the first 10 times she says it, she'll let you know another 28 times. All within 10 minutes.Is this what is considered "comedy" in 2019? I'll pass and give Dave Chappelle another watch.
The only reason this doesn't have a 1 star rating is because her die-hard fans are boosting it. You can literally see them rallying in the Youtube comment sections telling each other to come give her a good rating.
This is absolute trash.
1. I cannot even fathom how bad it is.
2. Lilly's Interviewing is worse than the nightmare on elm street's remake. And i mean it. she only talks about her self not about the guest.
3. as a white woman i am shocked at the racism political content this show is i realy wish they remove Lilly and add someone else Lilly would of been good 5 years ago when she was funny.
Anti-White 'comedy' show full of boring repetitive 'jokes'. Is there really a team of writers behind this?
Very unpleasant and difficult to sit through. Certainly the worst late night show
In a world full of terrible talk shows we found one even worse
I get that she's all hyped about the first female host and all, but she's taking it too far! All she does is mock men, whites, and fellow male late night show hosts! What kind of late night show is this? I am her subscriber on youtube, and liked her content, but this late night show is far from creative and good content!
I am in awe of how a brown woman can get on television embarrass her entire community, at the same time spitting the most moronic statements about white people whilst claiming to be the saviour of late night television.Aside from the joke stealing, she is just one of the worst "comedians" ever.
One of the worst late night shows to ever exist. This really shows how out of touch large networks are. What on earth where they thinking?
As a woman of color, I am ashamed to hear what she is saying. What a classless and butthurt person. Like, WE GET IT. You are a BISEXUAL WOMAN OF COLOR. Omg just say something funny and not related to bashing men , jeez!
I'm sorry but this is just not funny. Its painful to watch. The applause sign really gets a workout on this show. I guess this show is not made for me. I wish them good luck but if this is woke comedy then I'm out.
A Little Late with Lilly Singh has exceededing mine, and likely everyone else's expectations. From the intro to the closing remarks, Episode One has proven that Singh is ready to run late night.Like any talk new talk show, I don't expect the first episode to be perfect. Every show has flaws. I do expect that Lilly Singh will learn and progress with each new installment.I'm excited to watch this show continue to show me a fun, late night.
I love this show and think she did quiet well in her first episode. If you were off-put by some of the jokes in the first episode i highly recommend you check out the second. You will not be disappointed.
