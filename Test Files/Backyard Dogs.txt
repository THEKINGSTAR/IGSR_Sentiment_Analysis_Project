I'd heard about this movie, but never had any intention of watching it. Then one day, I'm at the video store, browsing through the no art DVDs, and there it is, shining with it's $1.49 price tag, screaming "I suck, buy me!" I figure "What the hell." I'm a huge wrestling fan, it can't be that bad right? So I get home, put the disc in and lay down to watch the movie. Less than three minutes later I realize there's no way in hell I can watch this thing alone, this coming from a man who has sat through practically every blaxploitation film ever made.Somehow I managed to convince my friends that we should spend our Saturday night watching a poorly made, straight to video movie about backyard wrestling, instead of going out and having fun like normal people. It was a decision we would all come to regret.This movie is bad. And I mean BAD. Backyard Dogs is so awful I had to consult a thesaurus in order to properly describe it. This movie is abominable, atrocious, fallacious, sinful, and horrendous. I don't know how anyone involved in this "film" can live with themselves. They deserve to be shunned by society, and live out the rest of their lives in shame. I've seen better movies at work on safety training.Backyard Dogs is so bad I think it might just qualify as obscenity.Rating: 0 out of 100 Billion
I had found out about this movie from a good friend of mine because his uncle (Robert Boris) was the writer and director of this train wreck of a movie. He said it was bad and it even temped me more to go and see it.  He was so right.I would not know were to begin to say were this movie gone wrong.  Maybe one of the major problems is the fact it was made only to cash in on the big wrestling fad in the late 90's.  Lets be honest nobody going to see this movie was exspecting a large charector driven movie.  Nevertheless, some how it was way below the horrible expectations I had already had for this movie. Everything was worse than I could have imagined.  The acting, the story, and most of all the camera work were some of the worst I've ever seen!At all, coast stay away from this movie unless you want a cheap little laugh at how bad it is.  I feel sorry for my friend's relatives who had put money into this movie! If you could call it that!
Ewwwwwwwwwwww!! I just got finished watching this movie, and I am about to run to Blockbuster and demand my $6 back for this thing!When I rented the movie, I did so under the falsehood that it may have real footage of backyard wrestling for more than the opening credits (plus a few good shots of FMW near the end). I was even more excited when the heavy metal riffs came on for the movie's theme song, thinking I was in for 2 hours of blood, gore and mayhem. INSTEAD, what I (and hopefully never you will) end up with is a former Power Ranger and a "sissy boy" form a "tag team" for 96 minutes of pure action - purely boring.My main problem with the movie was that for something that is supposed to be as unpredictable and violent as backyard wrestling, it was in fact more scripted and carefully prepared than a David Arquette match. It is a sport enjoyed by youths, some as young as 7 or 8, something this movie doesn't show us (dear God we might offend someone or something). As for violence, aside from the one moment involving barbed wire in whence someone actually bleeds (and then the blood mysteriously disappears in the next scene a la David Copperfield), the film is more tame and gentile than anything done on WWF TV, now or yesteryear. "Oh no, body slam on a bed matress, the humanity of it!" Where are the light bulbs, the cheese graters, the rakes, the bags of nails, and the twisting double moonsaults off of garages? Not here, because that might just make backyard wrestling look like the horrible menace that it is, and we wouldn't want that, would we? Instead we see hundreds upon hundreds of punches, kicks, and elbow drops! Oh, and a headbutt too! I could go on for days and probably write an entire 30 volume set of why I disliked this movie, but I won't - why rob you of the joy of seeing this garbage?Overall, the film was lame, boring, had incredible plot holes, had an incredibly lame love scene (knocks down door, pushes woman on bed and says after a few weeks of knowing her says "I love you," completely out of nowhere! Ugh, my girlfriend is laughing hysterically at the corniness of it all!!) and if anything made the world of backyard wrestling seem acceptable, if not doable to a generation of impressionable youth. If they were getting 50,000 "hits" a day to their website, how come there were still only 10 or 12 people watching each match? Even the "big one" was only attended by 30 rich white men.On a side note, I'm sure other fans of Mick Foley were as p****d as I when they heard that according to the Power Ranger that "Mick Foley got his start by jumping off a roof through a bunch of tables, right into the WWF." True, if you forget his years in the Indies, ECW and WCW before coming to the WWF. Good to see someone read the first three pages of "Have A Nice Day."I swear I will never watch this movie again, and except for comedic value or to spite those I do not like, tell another soul to do the same. If you want to watch a wrestling video that shows the true sense of the business, albeit a little outdated, go rent "Beyond The Mat," at least it doesn't try to BS you like Backyard Dogs does. If anything, Backyard Dogs will teach your brother/son/friends that if you particpate in backyard wrestling (ie. destroying, mutilating, disfiguring the crap out of other children) that big things will happen in life and that they will be huge in the wrestling business. The makers of this film ought to be ashamed for teaching such a horrible lesson to children.
I saw this movie on sale for a buck and figured it was just a bunch of clips from backyard wrestling. You know, something funny to show at parties and goof on. But to my dismay it's an actual film about a couple of guys who want to become legendary wrestlers by working their way through the backyard circuit.... a fake circuit that receives no attention from actual wrestling promotions throughout the world. Despite the fact that this movie was written by a total mark who has no real understanding or appreciation from the business of wrestling, and despite the fact that they throw in this ridiculous love triangle side plot, and despite the fact that the biggest star in the movie is only known for being the black Power Ranger, the most ridiculous part of this movie is that they actually make it last for an hour and a half. The producers ignore the fact that all wrestling is staged and there is no place for shoot fighting in professional wrestling. They pretend that there is an actual grudge match happening in this film. Why do they ignore what is so genius about wrestling and attempt to mix it with mixed martial arts type fighting. The Backyard Dogs get their name when their manager steps in a pile of dogshit.... I think that's pretty appropriate considering the quality of this script, the acting and the production.
Did anyone else notice the original black power ranger, Walter Jones, in this? Okay, he's not the greatest actor in the world, but he doesn't deserve to be in this chunk of celluloid vomit. I wasn't a big fan of Power Rangers when I was a kid. However, watching it again in adulthood I realize it's a brilliant piece of high camp and deserves to be venerated. My favorite of the original male rangers is Jones. Even if it was kind of offensive to have the black guy be the black ranger (and Thuy Trang, a vietnamese woman, be the yellow ranger) I loved his combination dance/martial arts style hip-hop-kido. It's a shame that such a talented dancer has to waste his time on these crap acting jobs.
I picked this movie up for 99 cents and it was a penny short of a dollar I wasted. If you take a look at the name I use here you'll notice I use the name Hayabusa, after Eiji Ezaki who wrestled under the name Hayabusa in Japan. Eiji Ezaki makes an appearance as Hayabus in this movie and I still came came away hating this "film". Think about that for a moment, a wrestler I idolize enough to use his moniker as my own and I still loathe Backyard Dogs. The only good part of this atrocity of a film are the 30 seconds or so which are a promo for the FMW promotion in japan, showing clips of the hardcore style employed in that now-defunct wrestling federation. Shot on video and not film, a soundtrack with the worst metal music of all time. Actors who obviously honed their acting talent in pornography. a complete farce of backyard wrestling and wrestling in general. About halfway through the movie I no longer cared about the main characters who were a tag team that this "documentary" allegedly followed. Do yourself a favor, buy an actual tape of backyard wrestling and skip this piece of trash.
The year 2000 might have avoided the Y2K virus, but it got something much worse: Backyard Dogs, which was one of many attempts in the late- 90s/early-2000s of people trying to cash in on the fad known as "backyard wrestling." I had heard of this movie many years ago, and I heard how awful it is, and I was looking through Netflix's wrestling category and saw this movie was streaming so I decided to watch. If you like really terrible, low budget movies and also like pro wrestling I say watch it and see how bad it is for yourself, but other than that don't waste your time. If you really want to see what backyard wrestling was all about back then, see the documentary "The Backyard," which shows actual kids running their own promotions, and is funnier than whatever this was trying to be.
My first real job was working at a small post production house as a DVD menu designer, and Backyard Dogs was one of the first movies I got to work on (the menus are the only thing worse than the movie - don't judge me - I was young and didn't know what I was doing). I didn't have anything to do with the actual movie, but as a lifelong Mystery Science Theater and bad movie fan, to see something that I had a tiny part of producing so much misery to people brings me a huge amount of joy.That said, I had to watch this movie about 7 or 8 times for work and I never want to see it again. The wrestling is awful, I assume. I don't know what good wrestling is supposed to look like. The acting is awful, the dialog is awful and it's shot on video, so it looks awful. I don't know what else to say
Seriously, I have to give this thing at least ONE star?.....OK, anyhow I just watched this on Netflix. Yeah, I made it through the whole thing. I think I deserve a medal of some sort for doing so. This movie was absolutely atrocious...Terrible acting, terrible story, terrible rap-metal soundtrack. I'm a big fan of pro wrestling, and I cannot defend the making of this movie in any possible way. How much did they spend making this abomination? I'd say $50 to $50.99 is a pretty good guess. Bree Turner is a pretty hot number, but come on. A hot actress will not detract from the point if you make a movie that looks like dog crap captured on film. And yes, dog crap does play a significant role in this movie. I am not kidding....
I would give this movie a 1 every day of the week, but I believe that Manos, the Hands of Fate deserves to be undisputed as #1 on the worst movie ever list.  Therefore, I gave it a 2, only because its not as bad as Manos. Don't get me wrong, this movie is absolutely terrible, but I would not wish Manos on my worst enemy.
What a horrible, awful movie.  I saw it at Blockbuster and thought 'Wow, a movie about backyard wrestling!  Excellent!'  And it went downhill from there.  Words alone can't describe my disappointment.  How appropriate that it stars a Power Ranger, because it makes it feel even more like an episode gone awry.  I just don't understand....the guys who do this for real do more painful-looking stuff than in this movie.  Why couldn't the actors/stuntmen at least make SOME of the offense look somewhat dangerous?  I won't even get into the awful love triangle, because it's not even worth talking about. Save the only film appearance by Hayabusa that I'm aware of, this movie is a complete throwaway.  Not even worth a rental.  If you get it offered to you for free, ask if you can have something else instead. >
I remember seeing this when it came out, back in the days of VHS tapes and video stores. It looked horrible, so of course I felt the need to rent it. I was not disappointed, as it was terrible. Terrible in all the right ways, especially the acting. What do you expect when there's a former Power Ranger in one of the lead roles. It was non-stop laughter all the way through. The "wrestling" was bad, even by backyard wrestling standards, which says a lot. I'd love to know how much they had to pay Hayabusa to be in this piece of crap. When I happened to notice it on Amazon last week for $1.99, I decided to revisit the past on DVD. So happy that I bought it, since it was just as I remembered it. It will make a fine addition to the "so bad it's good" section of my DVD collection.
Bob Boris came up with a challenging movie based on Kids going to town to town and wrestling unknown people and the places the ring was. The other challenge was that there were a lot of speaking role of which most of them where actors. SO to do the movie we had to have them join SAG as there are very few people that are Actors that know AA little about wrestling. Another problem we ran into is that the script takes place in a deferent location almost every night. The Director and the co- Producer were at constant odds with each other to make the Director's vision for very little money. From what I was told they shot this movie on various consumer as well as pro-sumer video cameras. This was shot on cameras that were not HD so the initial quality isn't great. This was all done before it was technically possible to have the video look like film. They got a top Lab Engineer at Fotokem Labs in Burbank to oversee the transfer from video to film at the end of the process. Everyone was very happy with the result. I think the film has a very interesting look because of that. When it comes to the acting it wasn't easy as they had people that had not been in a movie before, wrestling pros (including one from Japan that didn't speak English) and Actors who had never wrestled before. The nail talent had to go to school for a week ( all the budget could afford) to train really hard to become the best wrestlers we could afford. I can't tell you what the budget was on this movie but it was well under $XXX,.xxx.00! All the money went into the movie including the cool having on board an Editor who had to help solve many problems that arose making this 1st low budget video2film entertainment. They should have turned this around and made this an MTV TV series. It would be a lot of fun!
This had to be the greatest movie ever witnessed by human eyes. I mean come on. Bree Turner, Walter Jones, and the Raptor, you can't cast any better than that. The only thing that could possibly, only possibly make this movie better is if you added Jesus Christ himself. People, we have gold here, and no one is digging. Quick, hurry, run to the nearest video store and rent this movie and DON'T RETURN IT!!!!!!!!!! Screw the late fees. If the video stores don't have it, burn em down. It's worth the jail time. So throw away your copies of Glory and Casablanca, 'cause this and oxygen are all you need. I would rate this movie a 7 out of 5. Done.-Vincent Lawford and the gang
And don't be fooled if this isn't "The Best of Backyard Wrestling," either! "Backyard Dogs..." you know what? This movie is so cool! I'll call it "Backyard Dawgs!" What do you think? Okay! "Backyard Dawgs" has quite possibly the neatest, coolest, most awesome wrestling footage of any wrestling match I have ever seen! Even better than WWE - now I've seen WWE wrestling matches from time to time in my lifetime, and they are nothing more than just laughing material! (Especially Hulk Hogan - Hahaha!!!) Two characters you have to see during this movie are: - The very beautiful Kristy James! (I do a wolf whistle.) - ZZ Nash! ("Give me all your lovin'...all your hugs and kisses, too!" No, wait - that's ZZ Top! But both are good, you know?) Perfect Friday night viewing with your male friends!
While this movie doesn't have a typical Hollywood storyline , it illustrated a lot what the wrestling world is. The wrestling matchs ain't that bad . I'd say to you to rent it if your an hardcore wrestling fan like me. Me I bought that movie (O.K I didn't pay that much )and I've watched it several time.
this movie is a true to life depiction of the trials and trauma involved in prancing around in your underwear (i mean wrestling).  A dream come true. I could really relate and cried at the end.  If only life could be this wonderful.10/10
Why does the movie get so much flack??? Why is it in the bottom 100 at the IMDb??? Its because of an old theory "people hate what they don't understand" if you understood this movie, if you be loved more then its hated! Me being the hardcore wrestling fan that I am VERY much enjoyed the movie with its exciting story, some good looking matches, and a VERY well done climatic ending. I would bet my life that the people who voted for it to be on the bottom 100 of IMDb is because they are NOT either wrestling fans in general or as hardcore as me. So note to all the hardcore wrestling fans,if you haven't seen "Backyard Dogs" watch it...its FAN-FLIPPING-TASTIC!
This movie's great.  The acting on it's terrible, the cinematography looks like it was shot with a $100 camcorder, The premise of the movie is ridiculous, how untrained wrestlers would get a big PPV spot with a company that doesn't even tour here in the US... they decide there's not enough drama in the movie, so they throw the "bet cliche" in, where the two main characters bet over if one will bag the female lead or not.  It seems like the writer of this movie saw Ready to Rumble, then watched a commercial for the Best of Backyard Wrestling and came up with this pile.  Definitely worth a rental if for nothing but unintentional humor.
