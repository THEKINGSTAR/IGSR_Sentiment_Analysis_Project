well where should I begin and I think its going to be very hard filling 10 lines. don't look for this film in the Oscar nominations. firstly the acting is totally tortuous and in fact unbelievable and the lack of a credible script is partly to blame. industrial light and magic don't have to worry about the special effects on this film overshadowing any of theirs this year, or any year soon. especially note worthy, has got to be when the actors fell down the side of the pyramid landing perfectly clean and unscathed, but the best shot was the little dots that was representing the actors descent. well that's about as much as we could take and turned the crap off, if you have say 2 hrs to waste in your life then watch paint dry and not this so called film.
This movie does not have a story, very weak acting and low budget. If you have anything else to do ( water your plants, mow your yard, run errands) , please do it, even if you have been putting something off for a long time, do it and don't waste your time or your money with this movie. If there is a rating lower than a (B) movie category, this should be in the bottom of the list. the best description of this movie is a high school drama and film class project. all events in the movie don't make any sense, the timing in the movie between scenes is out of logic and sync. I think the director or the writer does not know geography very well to know the distance between two countries and within the country in relationship to the anomaly in the movie.
Where to begin!? I was really looking forward to it. 5 minutes into the move you start noticing really bad special effects, recycled scene (in one occasion the same clip was recycled 4 times.) Scenes that completely contradict logic and the reaction of the actors is far for involving let alone believable. The story line has more holes than a mosquito net and side stories that never find conclusion leaving with a "Huh?!" feeling. Raining scenes but all the car are dry. Plane finding characters in a blizzard 3 secs after they throw 3 phones flash light on. Plane does "water landing" on a tiny lake?!?! The city in collapsing in flames but they manage to find a taxi?!?! I can go on and on! I really thought this was a parody of the actual movie. In all; REALLY BAD ACTING, FAULTY STORY LINE, SPECIALLY BAD SPECIAL EFFECTS. It's so bad it funny!
I have always been somewhat skeptical of the IMDb ratings, and have watched many 5-6 star IMDb-rated movies that have proved excellent. So I was doubtful that WOI was really as bad as the 2.5 stars suggested - boy, was I wrong! This really is a stinker, the worst movie I have ever seen in fact. The people that are bitching about the cheesy CGI really need to focus on what matters - the best special-effects in the world count for nothing if the film has a plot, script and actors not worth a damn! The script is so bad that I'm wondering if this is not some kind of inside-joke as others have suggested. Having watched the entire thing, I could pull the script apart line-by-line, but for what - suffice it to say that whoever was responsible seems to have suffered from attention-deficit-disorder.This movie is so bad, it's in fact a gem of sorts - more people should have done themselves a favor and watched it in it's entirety - after all, without being familiar with what's truly bad, you fail to appreciate the really great films to the fullest extent.
It is definitely the worst movie I ever watched. I see better actors in the streets of Cape town trying to sell flowers than this lot. My TV games are more realistic. If I must say one thing positive about this, it's that the young lady in the movie that plays the daughter is the best actor in the movie. I think she has talent, but is actually sad that she acted in this crappy film. There is not much more to say about it.The father is clueless, the mother is stupid, the son is a creation from the devil and the daughter is just there to fill the gaps of stupidity. The rest of the actors is support for this family with no real purpose. Its too unbelievable to be funny. I have never made a film review or any review, but I had to search for a way to warn people against this film. It is really super bad. To sum it all up I would say its the worst film of all time.
This movie was too awful to be anything other than an inside joke, and certainly wasn't meant for real humans uninvolved with the joke to actually watch. The effects reminded me of that iPhone app that does the video effects - where you can film something and have cheesy movie effects appear on the video - only the iPhone's effects were drastically better. The acting performances... I'd bet my 1st born that you could pick random people out of the white pages over and over again and never get less quality performances... this movie should be listed as the 8th wonder of the world - its so bad that it will wow generations to come this movie is good for only 1 type of audience - bulimics.
wow !... what a train wreck !...almost begs for IMDb to add a score of 0.5 or 0.25 as it hurt to have to give this a 1 rating... my nephew used to make far better movies with a VHS camera when he was 8 or 9... his friends were much better actors also... :)I actually watched all of it because I was in shock and there was nobody here to shut it off, lay me down and throw a blanket on me...seriously though... I kind of got a kick out of how it just kept getting worse and worse... like a snowballing effect... will pick this up once released on DVD because I'm hoping there are outtakes or blooper scenes... better yet, a director commentary track...I can't wait until next date night... she's going to love this !... :)
I just have a few words and that's it. I seriously don't know what to say here and just don't know what to say I am speechless. My concern is not with the actors at all at this point but my question is directly to the directors REALLY??? WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING??? and how come you even got budget for this much as well? For crying out loud guys even with such low budget you could have made a much decent movie. You took such a HUGE concept for your plot but made blunders while making it. Didn't even keep up the flow of the story from any angle. People just came in and went without any reason or story whatsoever. Did you just started taking cinema classes and wanted to do an experiment? even that is much much better.
I was lulled into a false sense of security after watching 100 DEGREES BELOW ZERO and AIRPLANE VS VOLCANO, two Asylum-made disaster movies that turned out to be relatively entertaining given the paucity of their budgets. I was expecting more of the same in AGE OF ICE, a disaster flick in which mankind is threatened by a new ice age, but what I got was one of the worst films imaginable.This is a truly horrible movie and I can't think of a single decent thing to say about it. Gone are the cheesy, over the top effects of the other movies in favour of having a bunch of characters wandering aimlessly through a snowy field. The script was written by somebody with a tin ear, somebody who manages to create a bunch of the most annoying characters and plonk them into the dumbest situations imaginable.Seriously, these are people you'd never want to go on holiday with. The American characters are racist and obnoxious and the foreigners are just there to get wiped out (apart from the 'token' guy, a decent Jordanian). The character of the wife was the most horrible of the lot, I was praying for her death throughout but no such luck. There are no special guest stars here, just a load of badly-acting nobodies. Barton Bund (who he?) is particularly wooden.AGE OF ICE's storyline goes nowhere and none of the action has impact or drama. It's just silliness after silliness. Watch out for the worst car accident I've ever seen on film, involving a guy spinning the camera to simulate a car spinning in the air, oh and two or three CGI cars thrown in for good measure. Godawful indeed and it sums up a worthless viewing experience.
Before people start protesting that this is low-budget and not to take it seriously, I always take these into account before watching a movie from The Asylum or any other low-budget movie. The thing is, low-budget movies can have limitations but still be entertaining in some shape or form but then we have movies that are so amateurish and illogically stupid that they are difficult to defend. And the latter is the case with the worst of The Asylum, which as of now is where Age of Ice belongs.Even for low-budget Age of Ice looks poor, while it constantly looks lifelessly drab, has limited settings and has camera work that at times can't stay still it is the editing and the special effects that are especially bad in this regard. The editing is incredibly sloppy and has more continuity errors enough to fill a book the equivalent of the longest Stephen King novel, Age of Ice really has to be one of the worst-edited movies not just in recent years but ever too. To say the special effects are appalling is being too kind(like the editing they're some of the worst I've seen), they look as though the production team had forgotten about doing them until late in production and worked at breakneck speed to complete them with no attention whatsoever to detail, size, colour or blend. In fact, they even look unfinished and even the worst designed video game effects look better than the effects in Age of Ice. The music is forgettable at best and is poorly recorded, sometimes too loud and sometimes too soft, while the direction is flat and screamed of inexperience.Age of Ice is dreadfully written and enough to make you want to tear out your ear-drums. It constantly sounded awkward and with a complete lack of depth or emotion, coherence was hardly a strong suit either. The story was so thin structurally, so poorly developed(very little that needed to be is explained) and laboriously paced that if you were sure there was not a story here you can't be blamed. There were so many scientific and logic lapses too, and very obvious ones most of the time, that it was intelligence-insulting and there is the sense that even the writers had no clue what they were talking about hence the lack of coherence. If you're looking for any fun, thrills, suspense or emotion, find another movie because Age of Ice is lacking in every single one of those things. The characters are so annoying and cardboard that it is impossible to connect with any of them and judging from the acting the actors sure didn't connect with them either, almost all of them delivering lines like they were in pain. Only the actress who plays the daughter seemed to show any signs of trying and even she wasn't very good.To conclude, dreadful in every single way imaginable and among The Asylum's all-time worst by far. 0/10 Bethany Cox
Commonly in a first-look good movie your head searches for negative stuff mistakes etc. On the other hand, in first-look bad movie you look for positive attributes.On this movie the only positive thing i found was that its duration is less than 90 minutes so your torture will not last for too long.Honestly people, the direction and screenplay are equal to a preschool play, the acting is not acting, the sound design is plain rubbish and the visual effects (oh! those effects) are worse than super Mario.I tried (i really did) to find more positive attributes and i said maybe the music or the scenario or at least the costumes, but no. Age of ice kept failing me scene by scene and minute by the minute It is clearly the WORST movie i have ever seen.
I have just signed up to this site just to say that I'm speechless.I like bad movies but this one is just beyond reason. It is undoubtedly the worst film I have ever seen.Truly incredible.Storyline - I'm not even sure what it is. Acting - the usual low-grade show typical of these types of movies. Fx - they might as well have cut to drawings made by a 3 year old to explain what was going on.The use of the stock footage which is completely irrelevant to the overall scene is amazing, but when you add this to the fact that they then reuse the very same footage about four times it becomes... Wow!It's not even funny!
If you've never seen a movie made by The Asylum, then give this a shot so you know what to avoid in the future.Setting aside the poor acting, ridiculous plot, miserable special effects, and complete disregard for physics in every action sequence, it's the poor editing that really gets to me. In the opening sequence (which really isn't related to the rest of the movie outside of really obvious foreshadowing), a plane starts to crash, but the pilot pulls up before it hits the aircraft carrier. He flies it a little longer out over the ocean but can't get enough speed to pull it, so he ejects. Somehow, the plane then crashes into the aircraft carrier as if it hadn't just been flying away. On top of that, when they find the pilot, he's burnt and dead as if he was in an explosion, which he wasn't because he ejected. It's like they just filmed random scenes without thinking about how'd they'd fit together. And that was the first 3 minutes or so.I turned it off around the 20 minute mark. It's a complete waste of time just like Transmorphers, Terminators, or Snakes on a Train.
This is by far the worst movie I have paid to see. This makes " attack of the killer tomatoes " Look like a Hitchcock masterpiece.I will not even dignify this POS with description of SO many errors and bad editing. It is completely unbelievable. Does anyone think that the Cairo airport has trucks with BIG snow plows?????The acting is beyond moronic. The keep reusing the same B roll over and over. Everyone knows that Arabs have full winter gear with them at all times. Having a root canal would be a better and more entertaining way to spend your time. I think I need eye bleach !
OK, I had to give it a 1 mainly because the movie is absolutely terrible in every possible way. However, it had me laughing all the way through with its ridiculousness, mainly because it was the absolute worst movie imaginable. Now, having said that, if you are an actor, a director, or a movie enthusiast, I highly encourage you to watch this flick for the same entertainment value I received from it; it literally is a parody of itself, which if only it had been intentional, we would consider it genius. Now I'm thinking... I know a number of producers and industry folk. . . Anyone interested in seeing an apocalyptic parody? Perhaps 'If 2012 Happened' or maybe 'Day After Yesterday'?
This is THE worst film I watched in my life!But, alas, I enjoyed, poor acting, illogical and stupid plot, by far the worst "special effects", irritating script, awful editing....all these are so bad...that you will burst with laughter....and actually, it gets very entertaining, when you suspect all your judgment. The following are conspicuous : 1. Lousy Plot 2. Poor Script 3. Terrible Acting 4. Illogical Scenes 5. Bad editing 6. Awful Special effects 7. Scriptless script 8. Endless laughter!!The actors are so amateurish, that any randomly selected people from Timbaktu...could have done a better job!I am not sure of the budget, with little intelligence, better movies could be made!I request all the people to watch this movie without critical mid and enjoy the hilariously bad movie!!
This is a masterful piece of art work that any 2nd grader could have produced. Plot ? What plot and why follow the script, oh what script. This was a fly by the moment script scenes without any thought what so ever put into commonsense and I think some of special effect were drawn by 2nd graders. I can't get back my time wasted on this piece of . But I'm sure going to my money back. If your into bad B movies then I would have rate this one as a E for no Effort put into any moment, not even the acting. They won't show the movie The Interview because it might offend North Korea but they no problem showing this ? Don't wast your time money or even your effort to watch this film because the producer sure wast any of the above. If your still dead set on watching this thing you might want to get wasted first. I don't think going to want to remember the cliff scene or the ending. I sure hoping the truck would have crushed everyone of them and I could just watch 30 minutes of fake snow.
Some movies are so bad that they're good. This is not one of those movies.We all love a good bad movie. The kind that's hopelessly inept, but at least has a heart, or unintentional comedy, or some vitality or misguided ambition. Or some other redeeming quality. Age of Ice has none of that. It's just bad in every way that it's possible for a movie to be bad. How bad, exactly? It's as bad as your mind will allow you to comprehend. It's so bad that it could kill a horse from a 100m distance. I could enumerate the problems with this movie, but frankly I don't have the vocabulary for it. There are only so many ways you can say "horrible", "atrocious", etc. Just imagine a very long list of things that people often (or even sometimes) like in a movie. And then imagine a movie that does the exact opposite - Every. Single. Sime.If you decide to watch Age of Ice, then may God have mercy on your soul.
I had to stab ice picks in my ears, scoop out my eyes with a melon baller & throw cats in a blender...yeah.

When sudden and massive earthquakes open the Arabian tectonic plate, the result is unstable weather and freezing temperatures that will be unsurvivable by nightfall.This film has received some of the worst reviews ever. And exactly why is unclear. Yes, it is pretty bad, and the acting is among some of the worst out there. But this is from The Asylum, so what do you expect? They have never really made a "good" movie. Ever. And this is probably not the worst.Heck, at the very least they deserve a little credit for having some characters speak English and others speaking Arabic. Were they really speaking Arabic, or the correct words? Who knows? But at least it was attempted.
