Take Independence Day and E.T, put then into a blender with two week old garbage and you get the SyFy production Battle of Los Angeles. The acting is over the top with the base commander character as a 1030's mafia thug as some of the worse character acting I've seen in years.The special effects are marginal at best. The title of the movie and release is certainly to attract a viewer audience that might mistake this for the Battle:Los Angeles film release to theaters on 3/11/2011.This movie ranks as a new low for the SyFy channel even considering some of the awful movies released bu SyFy the past six months. I recommend it for film students who want to see how not to make a movie. For anyone else give it wide berth or watch it with an air freshener.
....and then it was just too much. I really have no point of reference, since i never saw anything remotely as bad as this, but definitely worst movie ever shot. Its worth seeing it only to understand how other movies are good in comparison. Even the bad ones. Is there any chance that i can sue asylum for a bag of popcorn and can of coke that i spent in those 7 minutes of my life that i wasted on this?? I understand problems with low budget movies, technical aspects of it all, but Flash Gordon was a low budget movie a century ago and compared to this is a master piece. Now i seriously suggest to avoid this insult to a movie industry world wide at all costs. And this is coming from a guy who endured an ex girlfriend sobbing after Leo di Caprio in a theater with wooden chairs for 2 and a half hours just to see Titanic sink. I can endure pain but i just found out my limits!
OK let me admit I am often mildly entertained in that this movie is so bad kinda way when I watch the Syfy Satruday Movie Spectacular. Because they are such spectacularly badly made films and on the off occasion there is a good sometimes even great film hiding there,well not this time. I want my 45 minutes back thats how far I got before I just couldn't take it anymore a first for me. Normally I sit through the terrible movies while playing on my laptop. I couldn't do it and in fact had to go see the real Battle Los Angeles today due to feeling so grimy from the previous night. The story if you can call it that is a fusion of Skyline and Battle L.A. and several other films the acting is worse the horrible with a script so poorly written I can't believe anyone green lighted it. CGI is so bad yet had scope it just didn't have detail or quality had this movie been released ten years ago u might have thought how cool was that but now its like wth I seen better CGI in commercials, even some films from ten years ago look better than this omg its just that bad avoid at all costs.
This would probably be in the worst 100 science fiction movies of all time. The script writers obviously passed it off to their kids. The director didn't come out of his trailer, the stars should have stayed in theirs. The special effects were the best part of the film, and these looked like a high school project. The sets are ridiculous, the military installations are positively laughable. The only people in this film that actually seemed to pay attention to their job was the wardrobe department, but then military uniforms do not require that much imagination. Why does syfy create this rubbish? I suspect it so that people will turn of the television and go outside in the sun for a few hours. At least that would be a reasonable justification for making this film. Considering watching this film - it is not even bad enough to be funny - just don't and say you did. No one will know the difference. I pretty sure the editor stopped watching it during the cutting.
It is a tragedy that there is people filming these crap and worst of all, some people pay money to buy or rent bullshit like that... Horrible... parody... bad effects... something like actors but definitely NOT ACTORS tricky title to fool the fools... unbelievable bad scenario... there was not ONE minute of at least BAD filming... all of it was JUST GARBAGE... take this for granted. it may be the worst film you ve ever watched, and that only IF you manage to watch this all... i just FF it to see if the end could be such a crap as the whole film. And surprise!!! it was worst!!! for god's shake do not try to watch it, it is mind-mixer and make you feel sick
Making a good quality sci-fi movie is not an easy work. There are some movie that we can call a not so good movie or even a bad and awful movie. But talking about Battle of Los Angeles, believe me, this is not a movie, this is totally torture. If you want to know how to waste your time in the worst way, then it's for you.It is obvious that the movie want to ride the hype of Battle: Los Angeles. Even so, please make something that at least worth to watch. Do not expect anything from the story, The title should be "Independence day vs Alien vs Ninja". The technology used in this movie reminds me of Japanese TV series Ultraman circa 60s Sigh..I wonder what were they thinking making this movie. I don't really care about the character in this so-called movie except the ninja/samurai girl (and it's because of the outfit? maybe..)Movie should be entertaining and giving you impression to remember. Whether it's fun, scared, blue or anything but angry to your self for wasting your time. This is what you will get by watching this.
Edward D. Wood Jr. is alive and well and working for the SYFY channel. Not since "Plan 9 From Outer Space" has there been serious contention for the worst film ever made, until now. It is obvious that they pulled out all the stops and went WAY over their $3,000 production budget, possibly by as much as 20%. Now I like a schlocky sci-fi flick as much as the next guy, as long as the idea is either original or entertaining. This film is neither. The plot is a direct rip off of several recent big budget films,there is no character development, the actors seem to have had around 20 minutes to read through their scripts, the sets are cheesy, with the majority of exterior shots filmed in either the abandoned enlisted housing complex of a decommissioned air force base, or a sand and gravel pit. The special effects look as if they were done on some kid's laptop while doodling during 7th grade study hall. But worst of all, it takes itself WAY TOO SERIOUSLY. The only thing missing is "Elvira" poking fun at it.
I must agree with the majority of reviewers here in how bad this movie is. However, it's got to be one of the funniest things i've seen since that awful 1 million BC. Everything about it is so terrible, yet it takes itself so seriously. Robert Pike Daniels manic performance instantly reminded me of Meredeth Burgess as the original Penguin from the 1966 Batman TV series, and when he shot down a spaceship with a pistol I was in awe. The rest of the cast were like the straight man in a comedy skit. By the time the swash-buckling Nia Peeples appeared I was rolling in the aisles. It's unfortunate they hadn't intended this to be a parody because the pace (and laughs) falls away in the second half. This is one I will probably revisit from time to time.... when I need a good laugh.
Started off watching this movie and expected the worst. Correct - that is what I got and as many of the previous reviews above I agree. This movie is a joke and pretty much a commercial for the lame US military! It is so pathetic and lame that you don't know if you are going to laugh or cry. I'm glad I could stop the DVD and go to the bathroom several times, but I should have let it run as I know I wouldn't have missed anything.One hero Sergeant who thought at the beginning of the movie that he retired from 20 years of faithful service, is being pulled right back into a war with aliens attacking LA. He becomes the "hero" that takes out the aliens command station and there the battle is won. Lame! While watching this movie I thought it was pretty good CGI, but still very unrealistic. Just another studio movie with skilled high school boys who know how to run a computer graphics programs.We are being invaded by aliens!? You gotta be kidding me. This is such a joke and a MISDIRECTOR.You have to understand that the threats of our everyday life is not from outer space - it is from ON THIS PLANET and the small group of guys that want to run and control everything. While the media is being totally manipulated and spitting out false information, we are being brainwashed - even by movies to think that we are "under attack". There is no reason for war and there are plenty of supplies and energy sources to sustain life for all people on this planet.All similar disaster movies around 2012 is gearing up to make you think that something like this will happen - well, it WILL and it is all generated by our own clique of control freaks that just can not get enough money and power to retire.What is being broadcasted here is another brainwash for the audience to make them believe that the "army" is the hero and America is saving the world! It is so pathetic and you have to be willing to look past the irony of the attempt to control our population.You MUST be willing to discover the real truth and send out a wakeup call to all the people that are being fed false information.As we are speaking we are being robbed and pillaged of all our resources by our very own government. We are about to get it to civil unrest for real from inflation and hyperinflation. The dollar is being crashed intentionally and you need to understand that this movie is just a distraction to make you believe that something bad is coming and "get prepared" and America will save you! The truth is that something really bad is about to happen and you better be prepared for real! Do some Google search and YouTube search on HAARP and then watch all these movies that are free streaming on line: www.zeitgeistmovie.com Find out for yourself before it is too late.I you want to find out how to get prepared, there is another website where you can do your own study and and you will get plenty of information and from the Google search on this site; www.amero.mx This movie is a distractor to what is really coming. Get informed and study up on what is really going on. The Battle of LA could be named "the battle of the us population" from the evils controlling most things even above the governments.Don't waste your time watching this movie. If I could give the rating it would be a -10 as it is just false propaganda for a fake operation and "preparing" the population for a DISASTER which will be happening soon anyway. Study the links above and be brave to find out!
There is not a single redeeming quality apparent in this movie. The best part about it was the ending credits. The acting, the total lack of personnel, the script, the directing, the special effects, every single part of this movie deserves a negative score rather than a 1 out of 10. If they gave tickets to this movie away, then don't waste your time... if they pay you to watch it, don't waste your brain. No amount of money is worth it. Bottom line - it stinks, stank, stunk and that is the good news! Clearly this movie represents Hollywood's attempt to take the consumer once again with total garbage. Where on this planet is there a military base that responds to an attack with 4, count them, 4 soldiers. Why not more, because they didn't have them available. Then, during the attack on this 'base' that was clearly an abandoned, run down I don't know what, a pilot from 60 plus years lands his plane on the runway... actually a dirt road. The commanding officer, who is loonier than a fruitcake, threatens a coward pilot with execution by his six-shooter if he doesn't move his jet, but alas, he is too frightened to move. This is all before the attack on the 'base' even starts. Special effects... what a laugh! It is just the same explosions over and over again from the same and different angles. And all this in the first 18 minutes. And it all goes down hill from there. I was hoping it would get better, but it only got worse. Much. Much worse! You've been warned - by me and others.
Im no film buff but this has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen.The film is just launched into the 'action' if you can call it that - I've seen more tension and drama in Prisoner Cell Block H! Acting is terrible, no emotions, and TERRIBLE effects that you would expect to see in an 80s movie.We lasted about 5 minutes before deciding enough was enough. I actually felt embarrassed watching it, it was that bad especially at the point in an air-force base in LA when the general type person was shouting commands to his pilots from a tin hut on wooden stilts.Do not confuse this with Battle:Los Angeles.
Dear oh dear oh dear. I have rated 1,148 movies on IMDb and will clearly have forgotten a lot from years ago, so it's safe to say I've seen a few films. This is, by far, the worst ever. It's so bad it's hard to know where to start. Acting? Nia Peeples is the only one who gives the impression that she's ever acted before. The rest wouldn't even get into the local am dram society. Robert Pike Daniel? Worst acting ever! Effects? Oh dear. It's as if the movie were offered to all the studios, rejected, then the team thought "Hang on, we've got $80 between us; why don't we make it ourselves?" Character development? Er, none. Holes in the story? How many stars are there in the sky? Needless to say I was hood-winked into buying the DVD thinking it was Battle: Los Angeles. How on earth I sat through it is a mystery all of its own. I gave the film 1/10 but only because that's the lowest score available to me. Ideally I'd liked to have given it 0.000001/10. Avoid like the plague!
Cheap CG and blue screen battles aliens.Made for TV.Derivative. It's got pods and the queen from Alien, worms from Dune (or maybe it's a sarlacc from Star Wars), and acting from the original Star Trek.Obviously trying to ride on the back of a major motion picture with nearly identical title.Not really anything positive about it, unless you're bored with no other sci-fi to watch.Where are the MST2K bots when you need them?Right up there with Plan 9 From Outer Space, but not as entertaining.
Perhaps one of the worst sci-fi films ever produced. I get it that it was super=low budget (for the day) and was produced outside of the major Hollywood studios. I love that, and wanted to love this film because of those facts. I can't. It is terrible. The special effects are great...for a film released in 1994. The dialog and pseudo-military jargon are especially bad. The action, which should make this movie, is killed by the long, slow lead-ins.A sci-fi film done on a low budget? I really, really wanted to like it, so much so that I could have looked past the horrific dialogue, outdated special effects and cgi, or the predictable story line. But the overwhelming, overall cheese factor is too great - this is no cult-classic-to-be, this is a ridiculously bad movie. Character development? What is character development? You won't find it here.The low budget is unfortunate, in this case: it means that the producers will likely turn a profit, and thus be encouraged and financially able to make more movies. What a stinker. This makes District 9 look like Gone With The Wind meets The Empire Strikes Back.
This is the Asylum's knock-off imitator of the big BATTLE: L.A., and it's pretty dull. The film is muddled by poor pacing, extreme predictability, characters we don't care about, and lack of scope. Budget reasons no doubt affected the latter, resulting in a film that never really visualized the full extent of its concept; all of the action stays concentrated within a small group. Amidst that microcosm, however, the film has action aplenty, although much of it is hampered by the director's turgid pacing – reaction shots hold forever and are repeated over and over at the expense of engaging editing and propulsive forward motion so that the film even at its most exciting seems to proceed at a snail's pace. Cast does okay, especially Nia Peeples as an Area-51 styled military agent whose skill with a katana sword, however incongruous in the modern military, is thrilling, and Robert Pike Daniel as a crusty old-school soldier who takes pot shots at the alien saucers with a revolver, and steals the whole show. A first-rate synth-and-samples score by Brian Ralston & Kays Al-Atrakchi gives the story what propulsion it manages to gather. As the equivalent of a "B" movie it's passable entertainment for the undemanding, but most of us are demanding coherency and creativity. BoLA's story sustains little of that.
The Mockbuster Factory returns with what may be their most audaciously titled/timed ripoff yet. The big budget sci-fi flick "Battle: Los Angeles" has just hit theaters and a day later "Battle Of Los Angeles" (note the "Of" in the title, people - totally different film!) airs as the SyFy Channel's Saturday Night Original Movie. I wonder how many people were dumb enough to tune in thinking that they were going to be getting the "real" blockbuster for free. If so - joke's on you!! Anyway, I haven't seen the "real" "Battle: Los Angeles," but what I've seen in the trailers, it appears to owe a lot to "Independence Day," and therefore so does "Battle OF Los Angeles." In both versions, a giant spaceship drops out of the skies over the City of Angels, apparently impervious to all Earth weaponry. In the "real" movie, the only ones who can do anything about the alien invasion are a platoon of tough-as-nails U.S. Marines. In the Asylum version, it's a small band of Air National Guardsmen stationed in the hills.It must be said that the special effects in the first ten or fifteen minutes of "Battle of Los Angeles" actually look somewhat promising. While still characteristically Asylum/SyFy Channel cheap, the invasion/battle scene that opens the film looks like they at least put some kind of effort into it. I would imagine that the majority of the film's (small) budget went into that sequence, as the rest of the film doesn't come close to measuring up to it. From here, all resemblance to the real "Battle: Los Angeles" ceases. Instead of Aaron Eckhardt and Michelle Rodriguez, we get Kel Mitchell (yes, the former "Welcome to Good Burger, can I take your order?" guy from Nickelodeon) and Nia Peeples. Nia is a sword-swingin' Area 51 ass kicker (aging gracefully in a "Resident Evil" style cat suit) who leads the band of military survivors through the desert (random observation: have you ever noticed how many Asylum films deal with "a small band of survivors traveling through the desert?" I'd say it accounts for a good half of their filmography!)to a final showdown on board the alien ship. I realize this plot description is rather vague, but then that's because as far as I could tell, the film had no real plot to speak of. It's basically a series of random fight scenes, stuff lifted from other (better) movies, lots of people running, guns being fired and stuff blowin' up (in the Asylum's trademark, laughably cheap CGI) and a whole lot of ridiculous dialogue. Shoehorned in for no apparent reason is a fighter pilot from 1942 (?) who is not what he appears to be, a grizzled old airman who tries to shoot down alien ships with a Colt revolver, and "advanced alien weaponry" that looks like it came off the shelves of Toys-R-Us. In short, if you tuned into this movie thinking you were getting the real "Battle: Los Angeles," then you deserve what you got. Bad movie fans who are in on the Asylum's joke will have a hoot and a holler picking apart the usual round of inconsistencies (such as Peeples' suddenly-appearing eye patch) and technical errors. Sit back with a six pack and enjoy. Judging from the reviews I've read of the "real" "Battle Los Angeles" movie, this Asylum-ized version is probably more entertaining anyway.
For a SyFy movie, then "Battle of Los Angeles" was actually somewhat surprising. Why you may ask? Well, first off all, the effects in the movie were actually decent enough, except for the explosions from the hand grenades. They were the weakest explosion ever. The alien spacecrafts and vehicles were actually nicely made, except for the weird robot-like vehicle that was fashioned from a modern day bomb-removal unit. That was just hilarious.And for an invading force of aliens with the ability to travel through space, wouldn't you think they had some firepower beyond projectile bullets? That was also hilarious.Similar to the "World Invasion: Battle Los Angeles", this movie wasn't overly rich on a solid story. You were just thrown into the chaos and were left to sort out the ends yourself.For some reason we never saw anything from the streets, you would assume that there would be chaos on the streets, with people panicking, police and military mobilizing, but no, that was not be. Instead we get less than 10 soldiers taking up arms, lead by some anti-social, overly angry and cursing officer. I have never heard of an officer addressing his subordinates in that manner. I wonder what they were thinking with that one. And to top it off, throw in someone who auditioned for "Kill Bill", but didn't make the cut. What was up with the outfit the character Karla wore, and wielding a katana? Wow!And one thing that did amuse me was when they were inside the mothership, getting squished, then Karla knew exactly how to work the machinery of the alien technology and save the day. Marvelous entertainment value right there!Lots of similarities between "Battle of Los Angeles" and "World Invasion: Battle Los Angeles". Coincidence? That is up for us to decide, now isn't it? The acting in "Battle of Los Angeles" was actually adequate. Of course, nothing to harvest in any awards, but it was bearable to behold. Again with the similarities between "World Invasion: Battle Los Angeles", you got a macho lady; Theresa June Tao and Michelle Rodriguez. Another coincidence in actress choices?Truth be told, then "Battle of Los Angeles" is actually one of the more impressive SyFy movies, but it just suffered from having no real solid storyline, and that it had too much in common with the "World Invasion: Battle Los Angeles" movie. And that pulled the movie experience way, way down. But it was a refreshing step away from their usual big and mean monster movies.Of course, you know what kind of movie this is, you have the ending figured out right from the very beginning of the movie. It is just that much of a stereotypical movie.
Nia Peeples, Kel Mitchell,Tim Abell and Dylan Vox.Could not believe how many tributes to classic science fiction movies.Has everything going for it,Serious acting,Apocalypse sets, Uber machines,Tough female leads and developed males in support.lets discuss the computer animation aka CGI, Its good and BadMostly good and creative looks owing to a budget that must be shocking,Yet enough for the needed scenes. The lighting is even a strong point pulls you into belief of situation of the moment.Good job Asylum & SyFy and Mark Atkins who wrote and directed.
best thing about the movie, special effects, worst thing is the script, they did spend some money on this film, wish they spent more, casting is not good. directing is not good, the story is good, script is iffy at best. its not the worst movie i seen in a while, its nothing great. not a bad flick when there is not much of a choice on what to see. on the plus side there is lots of fighting. it could of been a contender if it just had a bit more of everything. i have to admit i would like to see a squeal made with better directing,script and cast. so grab a cold one, kick back and enjoy a senseless human vs alien movie and don't expect to much besides the special effects.
Nobody likes to admit it, but we all do it. Everyone reduces the speed of their cars to a near crawl to rubberneck across the road the twisted remains of a tragic car crash.And if you're looking for the movie equivalent of a multiple car pile-up, look no further than 'Battle of Los Angeles' by Asylum Studios. In fact I've actually turned into a bit of a junkie for these spectacularly bad movies by Asylum Studios and am seriously considering buying DVDs of all the movies they've made. If there was an academy award for 'Ballsiest Choice of Movie Title', these guys would win it every year, hands down. 'The Terminators', 'Almighty Thor', 'Alien vs Hunter', '2012:Ice Age', 'The Day The Earth Stopped'. If there was a 'Duping the Public into buying the wrong DVD award', they'd win that too.The barnyard production values are almost reminiscent of a school play. You could almost picture a school teacher desperately trying to get some enthusiasm from the actors who would rather be doing something else. The story itself is from the same cookie cutter mold as are most alien invasion movies nowadays. Aliens either want our planet, it's resources, or maybe they've just started receiving the 1st broadcasts of Americas Got Talent and believe that the humane thing to do would be to put us out of our misery.In any case, don't try to make sense of this one. Stop being a critic for a while and just enjoy this movie as it cranks up the hammy acting, senseless action and moronic story telling to the max.This is poor movie making at it's very best.
