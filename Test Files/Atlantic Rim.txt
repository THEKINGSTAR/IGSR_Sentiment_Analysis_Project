What was that crap?, AAAAARRRGGH it was awful, i could only bare watching it for 5m, cheap ass knock off, I could make a better movie without even spending £1. I was amazed at how GOOD the actors were at "ACTING" - OK no lets be honest, they suck, should give up on their carrier and start working at the Burger Kng or something, this movie was ATROCIOUS, not even worth downloading, waste of bandwidth and a waste of space on your Hard Drive, after watching this I had to turn off the TV and computer and start reading something to get it off my head, Damn.Seriously watch it for yourself and judge this crap, then tell me if it was worth it.
Is this movie a school project? Well they don't deserve a high grade, I know of 7 year old that make better flicks than this whole movie.Acting is non-existent. Dialogues are dumb. CGI is terrible, you can do better with a free online 3D graphic software. Sometimes you can even "see" that what they are showing you is overlay on top of another image. Youtube lamers do better jobs than this. There is no logic in the way the movie goes. Some scenes are even inverted; certain scenes comes before the actual action happened. If military would be like these people we would all be Germans right now.So many things in this movie make no sense that I cannot even start listing them, it would take too many pages.This is a big waste of time.
Sirst off i'm surprised no one noticed that the first 3 reviews that gave this steaming pile of poop 10 stars, this is the ONLY movie they have ever reviewed, and all of the accounts opened in the past year. I'm not sure why IMDb hasn't taken care of this. Second, this is such a bad movie i'm not even sure how people agreed to release this. It's like a high school media project and the kids asked a few grownups to be the actors. I wouldn't doubt it had a budged of around $30,000. Its that bad, the director should save humanity by not making a single movie in the future. Im actually going to contact xbox to refund my $5 rental money back and I have never done that in my life.
I used all my bandwidth trying to get this movie. Tried 3 times. and still did not get to watch it :-( Also I do not know why I need to do 10 lines of text. I was able to say every thing that was needed in only 2. But if that is the way that it must be done. Then that is the way I must do it right. If I get to see the movie then I will come back and let you know what I think about it. Crud that was only 6 lines. I mean I do not know what to say because I have not yet bean able to see Atlantic Rim. I did hear from some fiends that it was a good flick. I can only hope that soon I can say the same. Wow one more line I think I should have not used # and spelled out every thing.
Have yet to see Pacific Rim, but the probability of it being worse than this is highly unlikely. There are worse movies from The Asylum than Atlantic Rim, but is that saying much? The Asylum have been capable of some tolerable movies and some movies that have a lot of flaws but have a dumb sort of fun(the recent Sharknado fitted in this category), then there are some that are lame but with its moments and some that are bottom-of-the-barrel. Atlantic Rim is bottom-of-the-barrel quality, it not only is so badly done in every way but there isn't any novelty value to make it fun, whereas some other terrible Asylum movies did have specks of that. There are worse special effects from The Asylum and they are the least bad asset of Atlantic Rim, the robots are very Power Rangers-like but they do look decent though the sea creature is slapdash and doesn't seem that much of a threat. In other technical areas Atlantic Rim fares worse, the editing and camera work are rushed and frenzied, making some scenes containing action not very cohesive and the sound effects and mixing are muddied. The music is generic and doesn't come across as memorable at all, sometimes at a sluggish tempo which made it a rather dull score too. The dialogue is just painful, the interplay between the soldiers is awkward and the actors look even more uncomfortable delivering it while the scripting itself is shallow and rambling and if you're looking for sense you won't find it. The story as to be expected shows The Asylum's complete lack of originality, it's a decent idea but executed horribly. The pacing is hugely problematic in the movie, there is a lot of irrelevant filler and exposition that bogs everything down significantly while the action is rushed and done in such a half-hearted. Anybody who expects thrills, fun and a little suspense are better off finding something else, none of those things are in Atlantic Rim. None of the characters are likable, they have cardboard personalities- once you get over the fact that once again The Asylum are using literally every cliché in the book- and are severely undeveloped, to make things worse the soldiers are annoying and the villain is like one from a bad Saturday morning cartoon. The acting gives insult to the word amateurish, with a mix of looking constipated, bad overacting, having the inability of acting scared or fearful of their situation and just acting emotionless. Atlantic Rim joins the long list of low-budget movies where a capable actor gives a lousy performance, in this case Graeme Greene, and there are the obligatory beautiful women whose acting talents don't match their looks. All in all, just terrible with no entertainment value to be had. And that is even when you know what to expect. 1/10 Bethany Cox
This movie is utterly dreadful, although that is the precise point of these 'mockbusters'. My flatmate and I watch a s**t movie every other Sunday - we call it "S**t Movie Sunday." This one didn't disappoint. The highlights of this movie (i.e. the most 's**t' parts) are as follows:The moment when a 6-second clip of a jet flying across a sunset was re-used 5 times in a 10 minute action sequence. The 'Love Triangle' which lasts about 21 seconds.A homeless guy getting jumped in an alleyway by the main characters for no apparent reason.This movie is absolutely dreadful... please watch it at your own risk.
As awful as Plan 9 from Outer Space is, this awful film can't dethrone it. The actors here aren't animated enough to be laughable, and the endless technical errors don't stand up and wave or wobble at you. You wouldn't notice unless you actually think about it.I just loved the fighters that reached the fight with the first monster so quickly that they must have broken Mach 10. And gee, flown by pilots who don't use any normal terminology, don't know what weapons are on the plane (a .50 cal on a fighter?!?), and the weapons they do find don't work that way.Oh, and as a former aircraft carrier crewman, I was especially interest in the various battle groups. Things sure have changed. Back in 1980. a carrier in a big hurry could get a bit over 30 knots. All the ships anybody sent for in the first crisis, however, were on station in seconds. Has the Navy adopted magic ships? I won't go on because I can't. I got a headache from pounding my head on the desk.
Michael Scott's movie "Threat Level Midnight" was probably better than this pile of garbage.
Just watched this dreadful movie which I found to be utter rubbish.Oh yes indeed it is a gutter budget movie full of cheap fx & major poor acting.From the start the storyline was going nowhere & the acting was so wooden. The movie moved along so fast & had no plot whatsoever. In my own professional opinion this movie was a waste of film. Some may call this a B-movie well I call it a E-movie. I would not recommend this movie to no anyone. There should be a law against about making slack copies of major movies. But in saying this I had to laugh at it,especially watching guns being fired by the army & there fingers were not even on there triggers,millions of tonnes of robots being able to fly. All in all I have seen better robot games from the past that have gripped me more when playing them. I am a professional science fiction movie collector & have been for decades now & I found this a complete insult.
This has my vote as one of the worst films ever made. Why did they bother? I've never seen Pacific Rim, which this film is clearly a cheap and nasty imitation of, so I must see that, to watch how such an interesting idea can be made into a proper film . I paid 99p to hire this from Blinkbox, perhaps I should ask for refund.It would take too long to list all the flaws in this monstrosity - terrible acting, totally disjointed story, pathetic script, cheap effects to name a few.To would-be film-makers, screenwriters and directors, this film should be mandatory watching showing exactly how NOT to make a good movie.
This is grim fair indeed I'm afraid, presumably to cash in on the Pacific Rim. This is a film made without care, craft or love. The characters, like cardboard cut-outs, occupy a space, but are completely unbelievable. The characterisation and plot clunk along to their predictable conclusion; and while the cast do their best to breath life into this desiccated corpse of a movie, alas it is to no avail. Add to this the power rangers style special effects and this is a film destined to be fast tracked to the £1.00 clearance shelf...which, by the way, is exactly where I found it.
From Oscar award to the only explanation being Alzheimer's or absolute rock-bottom desperation for a paycheck.Don't know what a "mockbuster" is? Watch Pacific rim then watch this. Your education is complete. Oedipus would gouge his eyes out again. You could hit yourself in the face with a hammer and your time would be better spent than if you whatch this. Even worse than Robot Jox...
i am die hard fan of sci-fi and "transformer" type movies.so i decided to see that also.but it was huge disappointment if you are going to compare it to some good movie.actors tried but acting was failed to involve audience in film.plot could be more better.graphics were also very bad.hero and villein were seen making joke of discipline of army and their chief (didn't bother about his orders)story line was weak.whole army was failed to kill monster and robots were sent to fight with fist and rods.in short nothing in film succeeded to have impact of any kind on me.really if you are serious films fan.you should not see that.specially "transformers" fans.if you don't have any thing to kill time count stars i promise it will be worth of your time rather then this.
........BA BOOM!!!!! Thing's gone."Entire cast succeeded in never connecting with a high five, low five, fist bump, hand shake or any other celebratory hand or body gesture. Solid one star acting effort by all, but additional star for consistently bad from start to finish.
How can I explain this film? It goes so far beyond words. I simply cannot use words to describe it. Words are simply not suitable, they are not powerful enough to explain the range of emotions one feels when watching this... artwork.While watching this film, I experienced uncontrollable laughter. It was wonderful at first, but then it tapered off and left me with a general nausea induced by a profound feeling of pity. I felt so sorry for the actors. The shame of being in this movie must surely weigh heavily upon them.Enough hyperbole. Let's get to the heart of it.The movie's production value was actually reasonable. But almost every minute of it was an assault on my brain. The acting was atrocious, the CGI was not horrible, but was far from convincing. Think Power Rangers. The soundtrack was utterly miserable, a straight run of "epic-ish-action-ish-wow-you" muzak that never seemed to fit the scenes, but instead served as the only consistent tie between them.The flow of the plot, the aspect of a movie that ties each scene together into a cohesive storyline, was just deplorable. The director leaps from scene to scene, the actors doing things that make no sense at all, only to end up at the bar drinking as much as possible (apparently this is what the writers feel good soldiers should do). I suppose it's reasonably difficult to outline a respectable plot when the story itself is so full of haphazard clichés. The soldiers don't act like soldiers, the monsters don't act like monsters, the civilians act like cannon fodder (of course. And they do such a good job of it). I can't say the movie was completely predictable because NOTHING MAKES ANY SENSE.I felt like a 5 year old boy was leaping on his bed swinging around his Jedi light-saber telling me, "And then the robots had weapons! And then the monster threw a submarine! And then they drank too much!" And all when while I just want him to calm down and go to bed so that I can think straight and make sense of the world again.I feel my score is accurate, but despite that, this is a must watch. It will teach you so much about good movie making, using the time honored "See what they did? DON'T EVER DO THAT" method of teaching.
Another Asylum cash-in on a summer blockbuster. Like they did with "Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies" just in time before the release of "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter" or "I am Omega" as "I am Legend" came out, so again they do it with "Atlantic Rim" in the time of "Pacific Rim".It is just shameful, isn't it? But still, you know what you get with the productions and movies spewed out by The Asylum. Lower budget version of potential blockbusters, with failing dialogue and even worse CGI effects.However, I will say that in the more recent time, The Asylum has started to post more money into the CGI effects, and it is paying off. The effects in "Atlantic Rim" were actually quite alright. Though the movie was just suffering from being a cheap knock off of "Pacific Rim".The storyline in this movie requires no brain activity, just switch into auto-pilot and watch the movie as the three good guys in their mecha armor suits beat up some colossus aquatic monster that came from God knows where.As for the dialogue in the movie, well it was bad, really bad. I have never heard soldiers talk or communicate in the way that they did in this movie. And some of the things they say was just downright embarrassing to witness.And the acting in the movie was equally bad. Steven Marlow (playing Sheldon Geise) looked like he had a bad case of diarrhea, while Graham Greene (playing Admiral Hadley) was like a drone totally devoid of emotions at all. And David Chokachi (playing Red) looked like he was trying to do a reenactment of "American Ninja: The Musical" - if there was such a thing.This is not one of the better movies to make it out of The Asylum's drawing board, not even by a long shot. Everything here was rushed and seemed to be half-hearted. If you are going to copy something and cash in on something, at least do it properly.For a Sci-Fi movie, then "Atlantic Rim" was a really plain and below mediocre experience. Although I have seen a lot, and I do mean a lot, of questionable and low-budget movies, then "Atlantic Rim" is not the worst amongst those movie, but it is up there on the high ends of the scale.
Atlantic RIM delivers exactly what you'd expect from a PACIFIC RIM rip-off knocked out by notorious production studio The Asylum. It's a film packed to the brim with nonsense, featuring some pretty bad CGI monsters and robots and robotic dialogue to match.I like del Toro's PACIFIC RIM; it's a rip-roaring homage to the kaiju flicks of old. This is nothing like; instead it's a bland, soulless production that concentrates too much on simply trying to join the dots than to deliver a decent piece of stand-alone entertainment. The performances are uniformly poor, ranging from the non-starters (like Treach, who was also in the horrendous THE ART OF WAR III) to the weary veterans (Graham Greene, a long way from DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE).The CGI shots are as cheap and amateurish as you'd expect, but at least when the fights start Atlantic RIM does keep you watching - if only a little. But it's in the various supposedly dramatic dialogue scenes where this really falls apart, slowing down to a fatal crawl from which it never recovers.
Wow,that was awful !! But also a bit of fun just because of the terrible acting .why was graham green in this film what was he thinking ,a well known decent actor even he looked crap in this .ok so it wasn't terrible dependent on what you were expecting and i got exactly that.the slow wet suit walk in the beginning is hilarious.then there's red the main man ,what a hero , what a bell end ! The sort of bloke you wanna punch in the face.10 stone of mouth ! And trying somewhere along the line to base himself on a certain guy from terminator)i reckon ,and failing miserably .anyway don't expect much and you wont be disappointed.
I'm being generous with a five star rating because Asylum seems to be improving on the technical side. The CGI wasn't half bad and the acting wasn't nearly as terrible as a lot of their other movies.I love Graham Greene and he is a legend but he looked absolutely miserable. He seemed angry to be there. His character seemed to clash with the other actors. The irony is, Graham Greene is the only well known actor in the movie, but for some reason I felt the movie would actually have been better without him. The plot wasn't exactly solid, but it was fun enough to sit through all the same. It definitely seemed more like a kids movie, not that it's a bad thing but I think they could have done somewhat better.
Pacific Rim is visually stunning, with great performances from Idris Elba, Charlie Hunnam, and the others
