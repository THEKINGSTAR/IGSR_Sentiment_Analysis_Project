I really cannot believe that After Last Season exists. I watched it, I lived it, survived it, but I still cannot believe it has a place on a website, on amazon.com, was screened in theaters, in the ethereal plane. I've given a name to my pain, and his name is Mark Region, writer/director/editor/DP. I don't advocate violence against artists, but Region kills puppies and rapes grandmothers with his nothingness of technique and storytelling. And if it's all a prank, it's all the more frustrating, since it has SAG actors, cost five million dollars, and was shot on 35mm. Actual filmmakers could have used that money. Resources could have been utilized by people who genuinely enjoy telling stories, instead of pulling bull**** out of their asses. Please excuse the cursing. As the serial killer once said, Region made me do it.Is there a story? Supposedly, since there is a premise listed on the back of the DVD, and on IMDb.com. There's a murderer on the loose. There's mind-transference between these two doctors (or two patients) at some experimental facility called Prorolo (or is it Proloro?). And there's a lot of CGI scenes of cubes and squares and cylinders... CGI from 1979, when it was so primitive it would've made early PIXAR squirm. And other things eventually happen, like chairs and doors moving on their own accord. And other things do happen, I guess, like people talking in rooms and, uh, walking into rooms and walking outside. Yeah, things...This movie melts your brain after a while. By while, it may depend on how often you check your watch in the first ten minutes. Sense is thrown out the window, but not even in any kind of interesting or 'fun-bad' movie way. In maybe all of five seconds the film comes close to that sense of being so crazy that it starts to become fun. The rest of the run-time (all of 89 minutes 57 seconds) it's an endless pit of awful acting by so-called actors (how they got into SAG is both amusing and outrageous), non-writing, a flip of the bird to continuity, and lighting that is just... what lighting? They rented one bulb and pointed it at the actors, end of story.Gene Siskel once coined the phrase "would this movie be more interesting if it were a documentary on the actors having lunch?" Why not a documentary on how this came to be? How does a filmmaker, presumably never having made anything before (at least as far as IMDb is concerned), make this? Perhaps sheer artistic drive to succeed? Does Mark Region ever exist? If his goal was to make an anti-film, something along the lines of a neo-Andy-Warhol film, perhaps he succeeded. It starts to make a disconnect in the mind: is the intention to tell its story, or to annoy the viewer? Is it a revolutionary statement against the notion of making art? All of this could be.What it definitely IS is a sham, a frame-job, a disgrace to a profession that allows for real dreams to be realized and ideas to come across, and it insults people looking for a good or interesting movie (of course), but also those looking for bad movie love. Don't let the ironic reviews fool you; After Last Season's best asset is its future as a reference point in film schools: don't do this, don't do that, don't EVER light that way, and let's learn how to make some decent animation. It's hard, or just frightening, to imagine any movie ever topping this as the worse ever executed... executed, that reminds me, Mark Region...
Dear, oh dear, oh, dear, why did I ever watch this debacle? I love movies and have seen a huge amount of them ranging from outstanding to awful. While I have seen some stinkers from this last decade, this drivel known as After Last Season really takes the cake.I seriously do not know when to start criticising After Last Season. When I first heard of it and saw its poster here, I thought it was going to be romantic comedy or a fantasy. But no, the makers intended it to be a sort of sci-fi thriller with (I think they said) Hitchcockian elements. To me, After Last Season was just a badly shot, appallingly acted, uneventful and dull film that does absolutely nothing to either live up to its premise or engage the viewer.On a visual and technical level, After Last Season looks poor. The setting is most of the time an empty room, but that wasn't what made the film so bad to look at. The lighting is very dull a vast majority of the time, while the editing is all-over-the-place and random. The music is also generic, nothing stuck out as memorable.That's not all. The script is abysmal, seriously this movie has some of the worst dialogue I have heard in my life. It was so forced and disconnected, and felt as though it was being improvised on the spot. As for the story, it was predictable, poorly paced and unfocused, with too many scenes where little or nothing happens.The direction also feels inept and phoned in. The acting was just atrocious. Not only are lines badly delivered, but the actors look as though they have forgotten their acting lessons, and some of them particularly the lead actor looked as though they were about to forget their lines any minute. I didn't like the film's title either, I thought it was somewhat misleading.Overall, this film is just appalling. In fact, I haven't seen any film this bad for a while now. 0/10- 1/10 would have been an insult to the other films I have rated by that rating, because unlike this excrement some of them actually have one or two minor redeeming qualities.

It's fair to say I've been a cinefile my entire life and have seen (conservative estimate) over 2,000 movies during my 40+ years. It's also fair to say that AFTER LAST SEASON is, by far, the worst.Technically inept, incomprehensible plotting/screenplay, and acting that would make most community theater troupes look like The Royal Shakespeare Company, all contribute the ingredients that cook up a Mulligan's Stew which makes any film by Ed Wood look like an epic by David Lean, in comparison.A friend who saw the film with me has a theory: this film was a huge scam (a la Mel Brooks' THE PRODUCERS) to dupe its investors out of the (supposedly) $5 million it cost. I hope, for reason's sake, this is the case! An old anecdote about Orson Welles, in conclusion: During his later years, when Mr. Welles would be invited to a movie or theater premiere that turned out to be abysmal, and he was forced to "congratulate" the director afterward, the great man would walk up, take the director's hand in his, and in his best bass baritone, look at the director meaningfully and say "There are no words." Indeed.
When I saw this movie, I expected nothing after seeing the trailer and reading some half-hearted reviews. I decided to buy a copy out of nothing more than sheer curiosity. After seeing the riot that was "The Room" I thought at the very least this would be somewhat entertaining.I was dead wrong.After Last Season is what I imagine they would make you watch in Hell, over and over again as some sort of torture device. There is no plot, the acting is awful and half the time I could barely hear what was going on since the sound made it seem as if they recorded it inside a toilet. The paper which is strewn haphazardly throughout I suppose is some sort of cheap alternative to set design or actually having to do anything that would require not having to rent some empty warehouse and use parts of your own house to serve as the backdrop for a corporation and a medical facility. The "special effects" sequences, if one could even call it that, are laughable and look as though they were recycled animation from the directors computer graphics course he might've taken back in 1993. Not to mention they add pretty much nothing to the storyline. I guess this was what they used to justify a $5 million dollar budget.If you can even stand to watch the first few minutes, in which absolutely nothing happens, you will find yourself struggling to stay awake, as it even took me almost two days just to get through it, as I couldn't bear the horrible sound, bad acting, bad lighting and cheap sets.All in all, don't look to get the same enjoyment out of After Last Season as you would similar "so bad its good" films. This isn't worth the time, effort or money that you would spend to try and see it.
Make no mistake, this is not the type of film that is so bad it's funny. This is the type of film that is so bad you will stare with your mouth agape and your eyes wide open because you are in absolute disbelief that this "film" received a proper release and distribution, if only to four theaters.There is no discernible plot beyond "these are medical students and there was a murder", there is very little connection, if any, between the many poorly shot scenes, the editing is absolutely atrocious, the acting is almost non-existent, the "special" effects and 3D graphics might have been slightly impressive three decades ago, the sound quality is unbelievably horrendous, the set decoration is pathetic, the cinematography can only serve as examples of what not to do, and even the opening titles seem like a joke.So is this movie for real? Judging by the comments of the cast and crew, it seems sadly so.After Last Season is, by far, the worst legitimate movie I have ever suffered through, and that is coming from someone who's made a hobby of watching terrible cinema (and with all sincerity, I was making more enjoyable films on VHS when I was 12 years old).Watch this film, if only for the same reason you'd watch a car crash: morbid curiosity.
What were they thinking? What were they thinking?! I keep asking myself that question over and over after just seeing "After Last Season". A plot barely exists, the "CGI" looks like something an 8-year-old would make in about 15 minutes after just watching a tutorial on 3D Max (eg. gray cubes floating around on a gray background or polygon models that seem like they were made in the '70s), the editing is incredibly bad (eg. shots of empty chairs, a ceiling fan and other random items seem added at random locations for no apparent reason), the acting is more flat than Olive Oil's chest (and half the time the actors forget their lines), the set looks like empty offices, an empty bedroom and a few empty boiler rooms with some random objects added to them, the lighting is crap, etc. I'm pretty sure I've met 10-year-olds in my life who could direct a better film in pretty much every aspect, which makes me wonder what the budget was used for. Was it just a scam to rip off the investors? Either that or the writer-director is a moron with narcissistic tendencies and lacking in social skills since only such a person would consider this film worthy to release in theaters.
The producer procured 5 million (Zimbabwean) dollars and got a couple rolls of butcher paper donated and voilà! The world's 18th crappiest movie. Some people said it wasn't bad enough to be funny, but I beg to differ. The MRI machine is made of butcher paper. The MRI sound effects are produced by banging a stick on a table while the camera lingers lovingly on a wall--which is perhaps the most interesting and shocking thing that happens. The editing adds unexpected hilarity. Bloopers are left in so you don't have to waste time on the blooper reel! The "actors" check their scripts after forgetting lines so you know it's an accurate reading! If you've seen the Coleman Francis movie Skydivers, you'll have a good idea of the electricity the actors bring to the screen in After Last Season. If you've seen Birdemic: Shock and Terror, you already know how editing can add that extra pizazz. If you've seen a screen saver circa 1992, you've seen 20% of this movie already. And if you have Microsoft Movie Maker, you can probably make a better movie than this. But I bet yours won't be as funny.
Where the hell do I start? First let me give an advice to those people who gave 10 star rating to this movie. I know you are friends with the authors, but next time, don't be so obvious.This movie is a crime against humanity. You have to involved in creation of this piece to even pretend you like it. The actors, acting, sets, soundtrack, CG, dialogue, sound quality, lighting, editing, script .... All suck elephant balls. To elaborate in detail - Actors and acting - No emotion, no involvement, just flat, boring performances. I am afraid that nobody could make this compelling, but still, its terrible.Sets - Oh my god ... its... empty rooms. Thats it.Soundtrack - Its silent most of the times, then some random notes pop out and then silence again. Exciting! Its like someone plugged in old casio keyboard and went nuts from time to time.CG - You, yes, you can do it... All you need is 1 tutorial in selected 3D program, 1 more tutorial for animations ... and thats it. Its really that bad.Dialogue - As I said ... boring talk about nothing. Plus they forget their lines all the time.Sound quality - Its like they recorded it on slightly higher quality mobile phone... You hear ambient sound that shouldn't be in there all the time too.Lighting - It changes from cut to cut, but its terrible 99% of the time. They use 1 to 2 light sources which result in shadows all around the place.Editing and script - Cuts to nothing, cuts that make no sense... Script for this must have had like whole 10 pages...I don't know how big the budget was, but it seems most of it was spent on cocaine. I know people tend to be overly negative in their statements, but this really is The Worst film I've ever seen in my entire life. Even Eraserhead who nearly killed me is absolute gold compared to this.
This is the worst, seek no further, this is the most boring, stupidest and cheapest movie you'll ever see in your entire life. They claim they had 5 million $ budget and that's a lie, because budget clearly wasn't bigger than 20 $ they're expecting you to pay for the DVD, this was just a big scam - director with hes crew took the money from the investors, split it with hes crew, made their crappy so called "movie" in one day an ran off. The CGI here would have been bad for 50s cartoon show, I could do better, ANYONE could do better, just get "Blender" or any other free 3D editing program, you'll be able to get better animation in like 20 minutes, what the hell guys, seriously, long talky scenes, where people, who you know nothing about, tell each other where they have been or what they have eaten, background noises, who no one bothered to edit, actors forgetting their lines. 20 $ for DVD, really? Really?! This definitely IS the purgatory of movie making, seek no further, DO NOT SEE IT, AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS. I seriously imagine people going insane if you force them to watch this pile of goo and vomit more than once. Just DON'T guys, trust me on this one, you better off with "the room", you better of with "Troll 2", Bigfoot, "return of the living dead: necropolis", "Manos: hands of fate", "disaster movie", ANYTHING, anything is better than this one. This is the bottom and if there actually could be movie any worse than this it would literally KILL the viewer in first 10 seconds of it. Period!
This film seems misjudged by the wider mainstream audience who howl with inverse hyperbole that " it's utter garbage " and " the worst film I've seen in my life " and " two hours of my life I'll never get back " but to criticise AFTER LAST SEASON along these lines is to miss out on the point of the film and perhaps to even miss out on the greater dichotomy between existence and eternal oblivion itself . Let me explain to you The subtext is in the title and wears that well worn cliché you've been told so many times before " When one season closes another one opens " This is not the cry of optimism in the face of irreversible mortal pain but a chronological scientific fact . This is what the narrative focuses on . The protagonists try to invent something that captures mental imagery and project it onto a wider audience . We've all tried to do this in order to explain our love for something . Our childhood memories have been molested and mutilated by imagery we once worshiped . My own childhood was murdered never to return when I saw a repeat of the 1971 DOCTOR WHO The Deamons in 1993 where a stone gargoyle a bringer of nightmares to me as a child was nothing more terrifying than a man in a body stocking and a paper maiche mask . The protagonists of AFTER LAST SEASON try to create an anti-thesis to this disillusionment where by we're introduced to a meta fictional concept At its heart AFTER LAST SEASON is a meta fictional mirror being held up to its audience . It was the great Romanian post Stalinist philosopher Wingrove Mann who stated " The mirrors are the eyes of the soul " and he's correct . For example did anyone think that down to the amateurish production values and the not unattractive female cast that the female characters might be ready to show their affection for one another in the most physical way possible ? A coming together of both base physical desire and higher emotional metaphysics . If so it's a mirror showing you what lies within your own psyche . When a character utters they've been thinking of a cylinder and been told in a reply of a basket both statements have equal validity for one is very similar to the other when viewed from certain angles . It is a connection between moral equivalence and empirical epistemology and ....Oh hold on I've been doing too many film courses at University . I'd just like to say this film is utter garbage , is a contender for worst film I've ever seen and wasted nearly two hours of my sad meaningless life that I'll never get back
Here's yet another filmmaker using bots and puppet accounts to astroturf their IMDb entry.This film has had 6000+ votes average to 8/10, yet has only 16 reviews, the majority of which are negative, and the only positive reviews are by accounts that have no other activity on them.Unsurprisingly, the movie is terrible. Filmmakers who resort to stuffing ballots (like companies that spam their products/services) generally don't have the skill or character to produce a competent product. But, if anything, the trailer's at least good for a few laughs.It's an incoherent montage of bad CGI and poorly shot, and even worse acted scenes that run more like screen test rejects than a promotional trailer for a commercial film. The clumsy, ham-fisted dialog will leave you scratching your head and feeling embarrassed for those with their names actually attached to this trainwreck. I'm not sure you could make a worse movie trailer if you tried.I have no problem with people making and promoting bad films. Everyone has to start from somewhere, but IMDb really needs to address their astroturfing problem or IMDb ratings will soon completely lose their credibility.
This is the movie that high school students watch to see all the dreadfully horrendous things that could happen in their drama videos. Extremely bad lighting which casts deep shadows everywhere, there is no concept of back lighting. The audio is poor with the sound being echoed and blurred making it very difficult to hear the actors. White paper is constantly used in props to make extremely unrealistic MRI Scanners, computers, half formed bedrooms and offices. Real bedrooms with fancy ceiling lights are used as clinic rooms. Industrial basements used in the film are half covered showing drain pipes, dirty brick walls and filthy floors with office furniture consisting of 2 deck chairs. The acting is so static you would think that they were talking statues. I expected the actors to move rather than be glued in place. The editing of this film is so bad that every edit makes you believe you are in a different scene. The editing makes you feel that you are randomly jumping about in time in 5 second intervals. In conclusion this film is absolute garbage and the rating has definitely been rigged.
This "movie" is the worst thing ever. And the only reason I put the word movie in quotation marks is because I barely consider it a movie. I honestly think it's just a slideshow of random clips with "characters" on a cheap set. I've only seen the movie once and I don't remember anything, which shows how boring and unoriginal this must really be. It's also known that the creator of this movie created a LOT of IMDb accounts to write good reviews and give it 10 stars, just look at the ratings! 88% of people gave it a perfect 10/10. Every time someone gives it a 1 - 2 star rating, the creator makes another 25 accounts to give it a 10 star rating.
Just... HORRIBLE! Why was this made? Where did the 5,000,000 dollar budget go? Why did the creator make thousands of fake IMDb accounts and give it 10 stars? He should be punished. Punished for falsely voting, and punished for making such a shitty movie. I do not know how to describe this movie. I went to a random word generator for that. (No joke) This film was horrible. The sound design, the sets, the music, the camera-work. It's all just horrible! How was this shot on 35 millimeter film? It looks horrible. It is a disgrace to films! Why was it made is the last question I have, and it is also my last argument. This film was literally burned by cinemas, because it was cheaper than sending it back to the creators. The only known evidence is the DVDs of this monstrosity. Destroy the DVDs if you have them. Please. For me and for the world.
In this review I am not going to talk about the film at all really but rather the pathetic attempts by the team to cover up this frankly sh1t film.Now before anyone complains, let it be known that I love film as an art-form and even when I think the film is 'bad', if the team has at least worked hard and clearly tried their hardest I can normally respect them. However, writing fake reviews to trick people into watching is NOT ACCEPTABLE! I'm not going to pretend I can see inside the directors head but all I know is that something is wrong with these scores...Votes Percentage Rating 5833 89.1% 10 45 0.7% 9 22 0.3% 8 18 0.3% 7 12 0.2% 6 8 0.1% 5 7 0.1% 4 10 0.2% 3 53 0.8% 2 537 8.2% 1WOW!Over 89% on 10 / 10, must be a masterpiece right, seriously guys just watch the trailer and see if you can spot a problem in this. The other problem that should be immediately clear is how the next highest percentage is 8.2 at 1... pretty big split no, I don't think I've ever seen one that large in fact like EVER!I'm sick of even thinking about this sh1t right now. I know you might be thinking "but Max what sucked about the film" so i'll answer...Everying!!! Nuff said. If you want to know the specific problems please read someone else's review, except filter by worst first as then you wont get Mr. Reigon and his crew attempting to glorify this crock of sh1tOne final bit of trivia for you, did you know that the budget of this film was $5,000,000 and that only $30,000 of it was actually spent on the film, with the other $4,970,000 all going into CGI. Huh interesting but one thing Mr. Reigon...3D modeling software does not attribute to $4,970,000! 'Blender' alone is free and while I'm sure the software you use is better than that, it may interest you to know that the software Disney uses is but a fraction of that (e.g. Autodesk Maya = little over $1,400 for industry level animation).Please play this clip of $4,000,000+ animation www.you tube.com/watch?v=UqIewqGUdOM After last season funniest scene {sorry for bad quality, best I could find quickly}I'm sorry Mr. Reigon could you attempt to I don't know, try, in the future. To everyone else, stop watching this film it is probably an embezzlement scam and you are giving this... 'individual' money.
I literally can't say there's a single thing I like about this film. Even for some of my least favourite films I can point out things I liked, but with After Last Season I'm at a loss for words. Every single element within the film is terrible. Everything. Acting, set design, script, story, sound design, effects etc. etc.I'm not joking in the slightest. And that's all I can say, because there's nothing else to say except the filmmakers created hundreds of fake accounts on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes to boost the scores for their film. I could excuse the film as trying and failing, but this slimy behaviour puts me off. I'd give it less than 1/10 if possible.
Do you realize all the reviews except the bad ones are fake? This movie is a must watch because of how bad it is. The production is bad. The music is bad. The maker of the movie made 20 fake accounts to raise its score. The actors are amateur and cannot act. Everything about it is wrong and just feels like a high school movie project. It is so confusing how this costs 5 million to produce. Everything is made of cardboard. Even an MRI machine. Most actors are very bright or dark and editing is horrible. The plot goes nowhere and effect are very bad. Must watch for how bad it is. Trust. Me. Watch first 10 minutes and you will understand just how bad this movie is.
Okay so I just watched this movie and I don't think reality is real anymore. This is not a movie is good. I mean this is not a good movie. I mean this is not a movie. Does this count as a movie? I have no idea. what is even happening anymore I struggled to find the movie in this movie. By the end of watching it I was begging for mercy and got none. It's a mess and will always be a mess no matter how you watch it. It's not even funny ironically. I can't watch this again. Never. Again. I'd rather eat a mountain of rocks while being bombarded with pirate beavers while trying to beat all of the Dark Souls games than to watch another minute of this horrible excuse for a movie. I'm done. If I ever have to lay a finger on this movie again then I'm gonna delete the internet.Well, I guess it's time for me to do what I always do and list everything I think about the movie (if I can)Plot: "None" NA/NA Acting: "Hobo-level" 2/10 Audio: "Underground cave" 4/10 4/10 4/10 Music: "Fell asleep on keyboard" Kazoo/Orchestra Sets: "Trip to the recycle center" Cardboard/10 Animation: "First time on a computer" 2/10 Editing: "Windows movie maker" 10/100-,000,000,000,000Overall: "Atrocity to end all atrocities" Torture session/10Recommended price: -1,247,639,452,946,393,649,236,492,649 dollarsDo not buy After Last Season. Do quote me on that.
I saw the old over rating of this movie and I prepared myself to watch a good movie. But what I saw amazed me... but in a bad way. No background music, no continuity in the scenes, without focus on the story, without exterior scenes, without close-ups, ... without movie language. This movie has a good idea for a thriller but the implementation is below the amateur level. If you want to know what is the minimum level then you must watch the movie "True Love" (1991) - made by some friends without acting lessons, without director lessons and without equipment (only one camera and two VHS recorders). (Search on Youtube: True Love zarsoft) Conclusion: the old rating of this movie was fake.
i hate this movie. lighting is terrible, sets are terrible, the acting is terrible, everything is terrible.this movie had a budget of 5 million dollars, with that money a decent director could have made a good low budget, instead this guy has spent all the money on cardboard and terrible animation.the actors look like someone is pointing a live firearm at them off set. the production design is terrible, you can see the seams of the set. the editing jumps around not really doing anything to further the. a plot by the way i still to this day i don't understand. if i could give it something it looks like the maker of this film tried, and sort of cared about this film, but it doesn't look like he knows anything about filmmakingdon't see this movie.
