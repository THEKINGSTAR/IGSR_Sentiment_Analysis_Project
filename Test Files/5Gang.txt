Every actor in this movie is a popular vlogger from Romania. The idea is stupid, the script is stupid.
This is one of the worst movies i have watched.
I decided to Watch this movie with some friends because there wasn't anything intresting at the cinema that we haven't already seen.We were expecting a so-bad-that-it's-good movie and we didn't take it seriously.However,this movie fails even as a dumb comedy to see with drunk friends.There were only 2 jokes that made me grin,the acting was somehow worse than a Neil Breen film and the "plot" is so cringe-worthy and predicatable that I'm surprised I didn't fall asleep.Long story short,just avoid this mess and don't give them your money, just watch it online if you're curious.If you really want to Watch a vlogger movie,go for Logan Paul's Airplane Mode,at least that s*it is funny.
I've watched snail walk past my house in 9 hours and it was more interesting.
I would have given it a 0, but unfortunately it's not an option. Not everybody should be able to make or to play in a movie.
I hated it. Too full of cliches, stupid jokes, 1.36 hours too long.
No, thank you
There is a chance that this will be the worst movie in history.
Worst movie,i regret buying the ticket,better buy a pack of ciggarets.I only watched it because of my friend.Now i measure my actions because time is limited and don t want to waste my life time
This movie is absolutely garbage. Don t waste your time
It's a cheap jokes movie with some Romanian vlogger mostly kids, it should not be called a movie
I walked out of the cinema after 10 minutes, the acting is definitely cringe, awkward, failing to reach even the youtube vlogging level...shelly had such a dumb looking on his face, it's like steering though the screen directly to your soul making you feel ashamed for him...
I resist only 15 minutes to watch this movie. Bad, worst and full of old jokes.
I think its just another cheap copy off an old American comedi film !
1 star ... too much ! It's a joke move ! Not recomanded !
A very bad movie.
Amatorical acting,ugly guys,irational idea
This is the worst movie I ever seen in my life :)))
Idiot kids making a movie like them, illiterate, unlettered, do not know how to speak their own language
I do not recommend this movie
The trailer tells everything. It shouldn't have deserved producing tons of money (1.1 million euros); that's because you watch the movie because you know it's made by genuinely uninteresting vloggers and you are very curious.
For me, the only reason for watching this movie, was the fact that Micutzu was part of it. I never regretted watching a movie as bad, as I do now. I honestly feel bad for whoever paid a ticket for this garbage of a movie.
Furthermore, Netflix, how the hell are you approving this joke of a movie?
I liked "Poveste de cartier" much better than this joke. 1 is a fair raiting for a movie with so many wannabes actors.
A collage of incoherent, vlog-like scenes - that was my impression at the end of 6000 extremely boring seconds.
The acting was deplorable, the main characters were extremely flat and emotionless, some actors were locking straight into the camera. It was awkward.
The naive love stories are fit for kindergarten, the action is lifeless and the comedy is (almost) absent. The simplistic dialogue makes the characters feel either bad and stupid or preachy and condescending.That being said, some secondary actors managed to animate a few scenes and the overall impression was that of a movie that is a bit better than 1 star. Still, not worth watching.
