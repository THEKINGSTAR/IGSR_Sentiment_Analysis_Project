Or, to be perfectly honest, they are running the film industry.Actually, that's a typo - it's not running, it's ruining.Another Asylum lunatic fringe production that adds nothing to any genre - it tries to be found footage, but misses the point, it tries to be horror, but misses the point, it tries to be scifi, but misses the point..indeed the only point it manages to successfully achieve and surpass, is the point when you realise that that's another 90minutes of your life that the Asylum have stolen from you.And that's depressing.I'm curious as to what future blockbuster they were trying to mimic - I sincerely hope it wasn't Prometheus, because if it was, the fail factor is off the chart - it's like they read a pr√©cis of the prequel to Alien, and tried to pre-empt what Ridley Scott was going to make. And failed with such catastrophic ease, that it's actually criminal to try and market this movie to the general public.If it wasn't Prometheus, then I'm left with the only other option, and that being that it was an Asylum original movie. And that's wrong on so many levels.The story itself was all over the place, I can't even begin to try and explain the mess the writer came up with. First they were doing an exercise in the jungle, then they were chasing "unknowns", then they were rescuing archaeologists (which, when you see the cut away scenes, will make you cringe), then were finding alien spacecraft in the middle of the said jungle whilst expressing not one bit of amazement at the discovery...Casting selections looks to have been made with blindfold at the end of a drunken night out with the boys, whilst they were decent enough actors, the mish mash ethnicity just didn't work coupled to the abysmal script and director-less production - all added together to leave us with a dogs dinner of a movie.Still, the fireworks throughout the tail end of the film were pretty.Oh wait a minute....I just realised....it's a true story, and really happened...and they're all still missing...Ah well - that's okay then.In short - watch this movie at your own risk - a little piece of you may wither up and float away if you do.....1/10
Well that's about 90 minutes of my life I don't get back! Truly the worst movie I have ever seen! I picked it up at Redbox and boy do I feel ripped off. I've been better entertained by watching workers paint the stripes on a crosswalk! I hope the director has a good day job, this movie is going to cost him any respect he might have thought he had when it comes to making movies. My only recourse is to come here and warn others not to waste their time. The acting, the direction, the video, the sound, the plot. How does a movie like this even get produced? I've seen my share of bad movies, but this is so bad it is an epic FAIL. The production company The Asylum Home Entertainment must have some really drunk investors who like losing money. This movie makes me want to burn my DVD player in case it is now infected.If you read the reviews here and still rent the movie than congratulations, you're even dumber than the producers. In fact, I've been more entertained by the people here writing reviews. They in fact could have done a better job writing this movie.
I don't like the Asylum, I haven't seen a lot of their movies, but most of the movies I have seen I have absolutely hated. Transmorphers, the Day the Earth Stopped, Titanic 2, Monster, all bad. They made two movies, that weren't horrendous. One was Paranormal Entity which was actually not a bad movie, it was flawed, but descent. Gacy House wasn't really good, but at least it was watchable. So their only two somewhat descent movies were found footage movies, so maybe Alien: Orgin, which is also a found footage movie would be OK.It isn't, this is not only the worst Aylum movie ever made, but it's the worst Found Footage movie ever made. It's a rip off of Prometheous, and it has one scary part. One scary part, and the scene underwater wasn't too bad. That's it.Most of this movie is just walking, which wouldn't be too bad, except that while walking, there is also no talking. Nothing happens in this movie, for like 50 minutes it's just walking with no diolougue. And then the rest of the time is just repetitive. I mean it, the last half hour of this movie follows the same pattern. Shoot, run, shoot, run, shoot, run. It get's very repetitive and very boring.Alien Orgin is the Asylum's worst movie, the worst found footage movie ever made, and one of the worst movie's I've ever seen.
Well....I can't conceive how anyone could make a worse movie! Too bad they don't have a minus no star rating. If that was the case I'd giver it a minus .000000000000001 Star.I won't give the plot away but it apparently low budget. Actors/actresses are mediocre at best. Filming was shabby at best and many attempts were apparently made to heighten suspense. But that's what they were...attempt.I don't want to give anyone the wrong opinion but there are very few movies I have seen that I was as displeased with.I realize I have a 1,000 words but that isn't enough to describe my experience watching it. I can summarize by saying I'd rather watch a buzzard puke.
I hate people on-line that give bad reviews and list their reasons and go on about how bad something is however I feel I need to express my feelings about the film. Basically do not bother watching this film it was so bad I had to watch it to the end just to make sure it was rubbish till the end. I understood what the director was trying to do, the build up of tension and the slow scenes that made the viewer wonder what was going to happen but that was the main problem for me was the fact nothing did happen. If the last 15 minuets of the film was done right it could of turned the film around and it possibly could be amazing if it did have a good ending but it didn't. This film did not deliver. Sorry but I felt that this film wasted my time.
Now, I'm not saying this film was boring..... I'm just saying that I've seen more action in a Care Bears film.It took 50 minutes before anything remotely interesting even happened, and even that was pretty bad.The explosions looked like they just set off a bunch of fireworks. The only interesting thing about the film was the scenery, the country of Belize is beautiful.The acting was sub-par and the graphics were horrible. They kept switching between black and white, colour, night vision, and infrared. My guess is to distract you from how horrible the film is. If you're looking for an intelligent film, look elsewhere. If you want a film to put you to sleep, then by all means, watch it.
I watched Alien Origins with an open mind and low expectations, but I do agree with other commentators that the film was just awful. The poster was cool and the scenery but that's it. In fact, I'd go as far to say that Alien Origins beats Titanic II(Transmorphers was rubbish as well) as the absolute worst film that The Asylum has ever produced. Alien Origins looks cheap, with choppy camera work, some of the worst special effects I've seen for any movie and footage that is clumsily incorporated and adds little if anything to the atmosphere. The aliens look fake and have no menace whatsoever to them. Another big problem was the story. The tone itself is all over the place, you are never sure whether it is trying to be mystery or sci-fi, in both those elements it fails abysmally, never being suspenseful or thrilling enough. It is also lethargic in pace, and never recovers throughout, and there are even times where next to nothing happens. The music and sound effects are generic, with little creepiness, in fact when something does happen they make it all too obvious, which I dislike intensely regarding movies. The dialogue is stilted and aimless, while the characters are stereotypical and have no likability or development to them. The acting is terrible, the actors show no passion or sense of what's going on and all too often it feels as though they were not even directed. All in all, Alien Origins is junk. 1/10 Bethany Cox
I watched this movie stupidly thinking it was one of the Alien vs Predator line of movies. God was I wrong. This is arguably one of the worst movies I've ever watched. It gives a 5 minute clumsy attempt at movie making by pimpled prepubescent geeks a real run for their $5 budget. The show was probably shot on a $100 budget and about $80 was put into designing a real kickass poster. Then the director though," Hmm. Another $10. What can I do with that?? Well, let me just grab a bunch of desperate superstar wannabes and offer them a shot at stardom if they each contribute another $100 to my budget! Brilliant!!" Well unfortunately it's quite likely the investment put in by the wannabe superstars won't be paying off anytime soon. The director should be thrown in the slammer for grievous waste of viewers' time and irreversible brain rot. This movie is not worse your time or money for rental. Avoid it like the plague even if someone pays you to watch it. (Unless you're in the mood for exchanging some brain cells for a couple of bucks)
The movie is horrible, I got a head ache from the constant shaking of the camera. The plot was very drawn out for no reason, the movie was %50 running around with the camera shaking for no reason. save your $2 and don't watch this failure flick.This would have been a cool short film. If they minus all the running around camera shaking mess. Unfortunately I wasted an hour before I stopped watching it. Its not like there was going to be a surprise ending. The ending is told at the beginning of the movie.Time that I could have rather watched the flies buzzing around the living room, maybe even pick one and cheer it on to do the most laps. Either way anything would have been better then watching this movie. It has earned the failure of the month award from me. The name is not even relevant to the movie. The movie name is Alien Origins, but it doesn't say anything about any type of origin. I could understand if it showed a 2 minute clip of their home world, or something, but NO, they failed.
OK so am I the only one that thinks it should be illegal to lie about "found footage" and authenticity? I am absolutely sick of these films claiming to be true just to get people to watch them only to discover quite quickly that it is completely fabricated and has not a single stitch of actual real footage. what ever happened to truth in advertising? why are these idiots allowed to keep making fantasy films and trying to pass them off as "Reality"? Look at the Taglines on here they are outright lies and its beginning to disgust me. Why is it acceptable in Films and no where else? If I were to start a Juice company and claim "made with real oranges" then you taste it n find its just water, wouldn't I be up on charges/lawsuits? Even more disgusting is that most people think this kind of movie could be real and then they dismiss actual factual evidence about things like 9/11 that prove it was not what we were told... Perhaps the worlds lack of logic and morals are getting to me...don't let this movie get you too
Horrible acting!!!!! Even worse story line!!!!! Terrible camera angling!!!!! Cheap "special" effects!!!!!! Can't even get to see the actual "THING" properly. I wish there was a "-" star rating for this movie. From now on I'm going to read reviews before and not after I see the movie, I don't usually write but this movie was just too horrible not to warn viewers before they watch it. The characters seem to die then come back to life, and for the story line, there's a difference between being desperate to find your spouse and just being plain dumb, as in the case of the couple that went missing. Basically, failure at it's best. And since when running around the forest shaking a camera is entertaining? They should have used the little funding from this film to either pay tuition for the actors, or the director.
This is the worst movie I have seen in a long time, it will make you sick if you just watch it due to the camera operation. I wouldn't watch it if someone loaned it to you. This is two hours of my life that I will never get back and I feel dumber for watching it. I would have enjoyed the movie if it had stayed in the ship longer and I noticed how they blurred it to avoid you seeing the plumbing in someones basement. I can honestly say that anyone can put out a movie these days and this one didn't even make a B-movie list for me. Don't get me wrong I love any kind of Sci-Fi but this was not even that. They try to pass it off as a documentary and some lost footage so don't walk RUN!!!!!
I really knew nothing about "Alien Origin" before sitting down to watch it, other than the title. After the first couple of minutes I thought this was going to be a "Predator" copy. Nothing could be further from the truth!After watching "Alien Origin" I'm left to wonder what was the point of this film? Was it to see how much boredom a human being can tolerate? Perhaps there's a subliminal message embedded in the film urging viewers to eat more vegetables? It certainly wasn't to entertain the audience with an engrossing tale and engaging dialog. I would love to hear the director being interviewed about his reasons for making this film, I'd imagine the conversation would go something like this;Interviewer: "Well Mark perhaps you could tell our viewers what inspired you to create Alien Origin?"Mark Atkins: "Actually, my sole purpose in creating this film was to see just how much life I could suck out of people - end of story." Interviewer: "That's a bit callous isn't it Mark, after all life is short."Mark Atkins: "Ehh, It's just what I do."Please, do not waste your precious life watching this film. If you really have 88 minutes to spare, why not clean out the garage, start working on last year's tax return, or better still, visit your sick Aunt Mabel, all of which would be infinitely more entertaining. 1/10
A COMPLETE WASTE of 1 hour and 27 minutes of my life! I don't know how anyone could spoil the plot since there really isn't any; it has no stars, no credible acting, no aliens, and only the faintest trace of a story line. The unfinished plot was never revealed to the poor hoodwinked viewer and there are many pointless events that have nothing to do with aliens and only serve to confuse the audience further. The camera is always shaking around and the picture "glitches" every time we ALMOST see what is attacking the "actors". There isn't any excuse for this video vomit ever being made! This movie really should carry a warning about how bad it is; the "writer" and director should also carry the shame of this turkey for the rest of their lives.
I am a huge fan of bad movies, and over the years I've enjoyed some real stinkers... but this ain't one of them. Even using the word "boring" to describe it does an injustice to the definition. The camera work makes me wonder if the cameraman was an intern. The storyline is preposterous and there is never any suspension of disbelief. I fell asleep about midway through but forced myself to go back and watch the parts I missed just to be sure it didn't redeem itself. It never did. It's the entertainment equivalent of Novocaine. While I also didn't care for Blair Witch, that movie was at least original and mildly entertaining. The only thing this movie has going for it is Belize. In fact, if you mute the sound, some of the film looks rather like a travelogue. If they'd stuck with that idea, they might have had something.
This is one of the worst movies I've seen if not the worst! It's beyond terrible! Please save your time and money and stay away from this garbage! You'll be doing yourselves and whoever you're gonna watch it with a huge favor!There's no plot, there's plenty of bad acting to go around and the movie looked like it had a $100 worth of budget. The director of this movie should quit making movies and save the people the trouble of sitting through crap like this! If I could give this a 0 out of 10 I would! Please stay away from this at all cost you will thank yourself for doing so!
I actually wanted to give this a 1.5, but there was no provision for doing so, and I couldn't bring myself, in good conscience, to round UP, so a 1 it is.what to say about a film of this caliber? Well, let's speak of calibers for a moment. The larger the caliber, the more powerful, the more impact the round has. Now, .60 caliber-that is what a mini-gun fires...used by Arnold in Terminator 2, and by Jesse Ventura in Predator, these can cut down a 2' diameter TREE they're so powerful. Then there are the .44 caliber Magnum, ala Dirty Harry, and the only slightly smaller .357 magnum, both capable of " blowing' a mans head CLEAN OFF!" Then, in descending order, you have your .38s, .306s, and finally the pipsqueak of the bunch, the .22, the firepower, if you can call it that, of your typical Derringer. What's my point, you're probably asking yourselves by now. Well, just this: if I were to assign a caliber rating to movies of this general type (Aliens, Sci-fi, etc., .60 caliber would go to, say, TheAvengers. Little argument there! Then, the "Alien" series, .44 magnum; Predator, .357 mag,and so on...... .Seriously, now, what caliber rating does a 'production like "Alien Origins" deserve? A .22? Hardly. I think we may have to drop way, way down into the Cap Gun range for THIS abysmal smeller of a flick. Yes, I know, I took the long way to this conclusion, but I didn't make the 10-line minimum rule for reviews!!!!!!! Just forgot to count 'em, is all!!! In summation: Honestly, the ONLY reason movies like this are made are for TAX SHELTER and WRITE-OFF purposes! Certainly not worth wasting more than 2 hours of my allotted life expectancy on! What was I thinking?! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME VIEWING THIS. (THAT IS my summation!)
What an awful excuse for entertainment, I do hope these guys make no money from the ten bucks they invested in this movie least it encourage them to make another. This is not even a waste of time, its minus a waste of time, effort and having to use your senses.
That's all. Just don't. There's not a single interesting moment in the whole movie. Run away.
Hello,I am normally not a type of person who writes on the internet, or who likes to criticize jobs from others.But seriously, this is one of the worst movies I ever watched in the last decade or so...They're copying an idea, they're trying to make it 'alien' instead of 'witch' but this is a kind of movie that doesn't even scare you when you realize that the shooting is completely fake.You can see that a lot of times, that the footage isn't real.. As you can clearly understand that this movie has no guidelines for actor's speech... The soldiers only say "Go, go, go" and "Move, move, move"... The girl open her mouth a few times, and doesn't reveal or appeal anything interesting for the story...Wait.. Story?I shouldn't even call it that! This is definitely the 'Waste of time 2012' Movie!!If the idea of these actors and production crew was to make a movie and characters that would be eaten by the Aliens and would never come back on scene?!?!... Well, I guess they made it!!(wouldn't be surprised that no one else will be asked to perform for a movie after this one)But hey, if after reading this and you haven't seen the movie, and you still would believe me.. then go for it! You won't regreat to feel by yourself what I've described... I had more to say but I'll leave it for more people with good senses.
