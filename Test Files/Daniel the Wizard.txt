A week ago i watched Daniel der Zauberer. I wanted to give it a chance after all the bad reviews it had received. This foolish idea ended up being just a waste of my precious time.THe plot reads as follows: A boy who became famous through a TV show has problems with people who don't like his music. The main character is played by daniel kueblboeck, the new star from Germans pop idol (so Kueblboeck actually plays himself). After all I'm proud i made it through the movie. To be honest i only watched it till the end to write about it. The movie itself is so bad it almost hurts physically. So this is a warning : DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!! DO NOT GIVE IT A CHANCE!( unless you are either a masochist or a küblböck fan). Don't say i didn't want you. This movie should receive a 0 Voting instead of an awful.
This is probably the worst movie ever.Daniel Küblböck shouldn't act. Never. Even it's the end of the world as we know it. Never, never, never.Some people give this movie 10 points, because they feel compassion for him, but if you are objective, this is the WORST MOVIE EVER MADE.I know girls like him because of... uhmmm I don't know, but fact is, he isn't an actor, he isn't a real singer. He only passed in the casting show, because he's funny, not because of his "talent".This kind of art-movie is responsible for 90% of eye cancer victims and mental deceases. DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE (except you are drunk or drugged)
YES, beyond any doubt, this is indeed the worst movie I've ever seen. Even the cheapest action flicks cannot come close to this outrageous offense to the eye. This movie not only is an insult to any person who regards himself even a bit intelligent. No, this movie is one of the reasons you seriously start to doubt, that freedom of thought is a good idea. The acting is nothing more than a bad joke. You might get offended if you watch this movie with even the slightest expectations. I will restrain myself from speaking about the actors themselves because I don't want to use foul language. So please, don't abandon your pride. If you don't vote with a 1 please don't vote at all. This movie has truly deserved nothing better by a sane person.
Daniel der Zauberer is probably the worst ... "movie", I've ever seen. And I've seen many, many movies. It's cruel. Save your money or throw it in a trash can, but don't spend any money for that ... "movie". It seems to me, the director didn't find enough real actors for his ..."movie", so he fills the cast with his family and family of Daniel Küblböck. And for all the happy folks out there, who don't have any idea who on earth this Daniel Küblböck is... He's some an former candidate of the German "Pop Idol", who's lack of talent is only matched by his airs and graces.Don't say, I didn't warn you.
First of all... don't watch this movie without knowing that you are going to have a good movie which will heal your wounds after watching this movie! A 5.5 stars rated film of any genre should do. 6.5 stars might even make your evening if compared with this movie. When I heard of Daniel Der Zauberer being in the bottom Top 100 I decided that it is my duty as an anti-Daniel-fan to watch this movie. By the way, I've seen 'Plan 9 from out of Space' too but for a different reason. This movie was the most horrible experience in my whole life. I almost bit my hand off while listening to the totally senseless dialogue's and the lethal singing of this halfbreed. He can't be from this planet! The worst scene is Dannyboy sitting there reading his own fan-mail to his entire family and giving comment on every letter written by young girls and old ladies...how can you dare? Then after this first torture he goes jogging and sings the whole time.I'm very sorry that he managed not to be shot in the neck by his kidnappers. That would be a reason to watch this movie again. I agree with my German friends that this movie is the biggest waste of time and resources. All thumbs down!!!Only goody: You come to see all his crashes and humiliations from the days in the Jungle Camp!!!Greetz, Felix
What shall I say, seeing the trailer was bad enough, knowing who the lead actor is makes my brain go to standby... Unless you want to get really upset about such a waste of time and resources, which this sorry excuse for a movie is, give the money for the video or whatever to charity. The acting is wooden, the voice of Daniel makes you want to rip your ears of, basically everything about this flick is so unbelievably bad (even the posters, which you can still find in catalogs) are real bad and I cannot imagine who would want to buy them.All thumbs down.This is the worst film in the history of mankind yet. All filmmakers will be hard pressed to top (or bottom, in this case) this one.
Obviously Ulli Lommel, the creator and director of "Daniel der Zauberer" had some urgent bills to pay back in 2004..Just a few facts about this movie: - the visual quality is miserable, the whole thing is filmed using a cheap DV camcorder, just like an average holiday movie produced by a nearsighted, shaky retiree .. The kind of stuff nobody would like to watch on the big screen..the "actors" are acting .. very bad! Think about the worst performance you have ever seen - and than imagine all the bad actors being drunk, insane, spastic and disabled in many other ways.. Than multiply the resulting "badness" with the number of sand grains laying in the sahara desert and you've got an idea of what "Daniel der Zauberer" is like! The only reason why this movie has left the very justified last place of this Movie Database is because the voting was falsified by organized hordes of "Daniel Fans", it really IS the worst movie ever made..
In few words: This movie simply sucks. To be frank it's probably the worst movie I've ever seen.There are huge problems with the concept of the story. Some might argue about the (non existing) abilities of Daniel Kübelbock as an actor. However you could imagine a story with Daniel Kübelbock playing himself in a self ironic way and some kind of trash factor supporting the rest of the story. Now Daniel Kübelblock is actually playing himself and the whole story is trash (if you would look at it from that point of view, actually more points could be given), however the film -I actually searched on several pages on the Internet to confirm this, cause I didn't believe it after I first watched the movie- wants to give its viewers a serious message and is determined to be considered as art. I would call this movie "Entartete Kunst" if the Nazis hadn't already used this term for their evil purposes. Still doing it in spite of this is quite tempting.Most of the other actors are better than Kübelbock, still they are far below average to say it in a friendly way. Quite amusing are the sociolects (in particular indicating uneducated and unemployed people) and jargons (representing a high consume of the German mass media culture) several actors are using. There are several slips of the tongue as well in some quite simple sentences. It really adds a lot to the already great trash feeling this movie provides.
Urrgh!!!!! Now, I know I love the movies with musicians as stars, and that many people disagree with me about this, but this movie, "Daniel - Der Zauberer," is one notable exception! This movie is not good; it's bad, bad, bad!!!!! I mean, we have the German pop idol, Daniel Kubelock (or something like that), a Michael Jackson wannabe, and we have a bunch of assassins trying to kill him! Plus, the whole movie is like watching "behind the scenes" footage! What kind of musical movie is that????? Oh, well. Guess I'll be watching bad musicals like "From Justin to Kelly" and good musicals like "Grease" for the rest of my life! Where's the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" team when we need them?
This movie won me a bet with a friend of mine. I said she could not watch this without crying, yelling or leaving the room.. well she cried, she yelled and she tried to left the room, but it was locked by that time.Do not watch this movie .. this isn't a game, this isn't negative psychology to make you interested and there is no message intended apart from "Do not watch this movie". Since the whole "plot" evolves around people hating the main actor, and you will hate the actor while watching this work, you get the distinct impression that the movie is actually aimed at you. Should that be the case, it's the cultural equivalent of stoning the viewer to death.
I am so, so sorry.I am not sorry for this movie. I am sorry for myself. Vain? Certainly. But vanity, I'm afraid, is a virtue in this instance.Daniel Der Zauberer (or Daniel the Wizard) is a movie about German...entertainer (...?)...Daniel Küblböck. It is apparently supposed to be an art movie about how his singing inspires thousands, but instead of just a bunch of dancing and singing (like the ego trip known as Moonwalker), it seems to have a plot. My German is negligible in this case, so I didn't understand *any* of the dialogue, but according to the handy Internet, a Goth band tries to kill him because his music is better than their's, or something like that.There is a character who I guess is supposed to be "the Wizard" of the title, Johannes Küblböck. Based on the fact that they share the same last name, I assume he and Daniel are father and son, but we never really learn whose side the Wizard is on; I was perplexed. Sometimes he helps the Goths, then he apparently is playing Santa or something for young Daniel (?). And there's something about a girl and her father, who are No. 1 fans trying to help him, although I honestly don't know what happened. The girl looks a little young for him, is it his sister? The ambiguity, perhaps, is the balancing factor of this movie. In many instances, ambiguity can set up a nice atmosphere, provide a bit of mystery...but this isn't a horror or mystery movie. It's an art movie, and an art movie where I really don't have a clue what's going on. My main problem was that it was hideously boring and the acting was terrible.Oh, and of course, I was especially creeped out by Daniel's...choice of dress. He's not gay, I'm sure, it's just...Ah, well. Terrible. And my favorite movie is Manos: The Hands of Fate.
First of all, as an excuse for watching this movie: My girlfriend brought this piece of crap for around 50 cent as a "joke-present". I watched it and used it to produce some kind of parody. Yes, I made a Youtube-Poop out of it. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1CfK5CzFSo) That was quite good material for this purpose. Now, to say something about the actual movie. It has very bad acting, a script which seems to be written for completely dumb people only and has very bad quality in general. If you want to have a good laugh at some of the poorest things mankind ever produced, go on and watch it. You will not be disappointed. Otherwise to cut it short: This movie is suicide for your brain. Don't watch it!
Let me tell you a little story: having once worked in a video store, my boss had ordered 15 copies of Daniel der Zauberer" – two for rentals, 13 to be put into sale. He assured me that this was a wise choice since, at the time, the name Daniel Küblböck was in mouth and ears of many pre-teens and teenagers. Küblböck made second place in Germany's "Superstar"-version ("DSDS") and was groomed to become Germany's version of Michael Jackson; music and persona being as artificial as the tip of Jackos nose. Surely a few handsome bucks would come from the rentals.Need I still mention it? Neither rental copy ever left the store. Not once. After having reduced the price to 50 cents, my boss tried to give the DVDs away for free, causing two copies to leave the store. One customer who took a copy assured me that this was meant as Christmas present for 'that guy dating his ex-girlfriend'; the other copy was taken by a drunk who wandered the adult section and who didn't own a DVD-player.Whatever happened to the remaining 13 copies, you ask? Unless my boss has used them as make-shift beverage coasters, they remain the only films in that shop to carry the label "Free".Is "Daniel der Zauberer" the fabled 'worst movie ever'? Well, sure "Daniel der Zauberer" makes "Plan 9 From Outer Space" look like a Cecil B DeMille picture – but it's by far not the worst film ever. Oh, by no means. Just check out any other Ulli Lommels production, for example "The Zodiac Killer", "Black Daliah", "BTK Killer" or "Green River Killer". They're all god-awful; all bad enough to turn your best friend into your worst enemy.You might wonder why I bother to write a review about such manure: well, it's fun to make fun of movies that are worst than anything you've every recorded with your cell phone.And now you asked me how many points I give and to pass judgement over this film – to paraphrase the "Black Adder": good sirs and madams, I wouldn't pass water over "Daniel der Zauberer".
"The distance between insanity and genius is measured only by success." Look at the success of this movie before you decide whether to watch it or not. I've seen so many movies in my short life so far but I think that this one has shorten my total lifespan since it was a total waste of time. If you're insane enough and want a challenge, watch it! But don't blame me after you've done. Special effects: wrong movie dude... 1/10 Sounds&Music: you know... he sings... 2/10 Story/Plot: no action, no tension, no humour, seriously: there's nothing 0/10 (not interesting at all!) Actors: well you know... i guess you can call it 'acting' ... 1/10 Enjoyment: seriously i doubt you're going to like it -.- 1/10 cya
This movie... is a disgrace to the art of film making, and to film makers everywhere. Why... would you make, a film about some craptastic singer who cannot sing for the sake of his whole family from dying? Answer me! WHY!? This movie, I have nothing to say about it. It's the reason why there is war, why peace will never come, and why the world will end sooner or later... it's that bad my friends. IT'S THAT BAD!!! Why am I even talking!? I cannot save you now... you are already.. DEAD!This movie, makes me want to stop watching and reviewing movies altogether, as it is the worst movie of all time. This movie, the director, and MOST IMPORTANTLY... the star of the movie, should lock themselves in a shaft, and shall never be seen again... EVER!!!!
OK, there's nothing to say about this movie that hasn't been said. The "acting", the "story", the "songs" - did anyone mention the wardrobe? I almost p***ed my pants when I saw Daniel in his yellow coat at the end of the movie. To all the people who gave it a bad review: Don't watch it if you expect anything. To everyone who likes trash: Watch it. It can't get any trashier than this. If you thought Helge Schneider makes bad movies, you will see that one can sink even lower. OK, no one in his right mind pays money for a movie ticket or buys the DVD, but I say: Gather some people who are into trash, rent this movie, have some (a lot of) beer and watch it!
Come on, seriously, I have checked this movie out recently.Its just mediocre, thats all. Sure, Daniel is a lousy actor, but hey, his career has only started recently, give him some time for pities sake! Okay, the script stinks, but I have seen worse (Braveheart, Troy and Ben Hur being good examples). Just give the young fellow a chance to prove himself instead of just bashing him without a valid reason. Its always easy to blame young talents. Keep the work up Daniel, although the movie is really not great. You should check this one out: http://www.3-engel-fuer-charlie.de/ (great movie) Heads up, Daniel, some people just don't know the ways good movies are made. Including yourself, but you can still change.
I don't know what I expected but I was totally surprised. When you think that this was Daniels first movie, it's amazing how talented he is. Sensitive film with a lot of good music - 3 new titles and some original scenes from the concert that Daniel gave in January 2004 in Passau 2004. I can totally recommend this experience. All the other actors do their best but it is obvious that Daniel Küblböck is the star. I must apologize for the intolerant German people who are frightened to try something new and who just want to see their old actors and old fashioned movies (Otto, Bully). I'm sure that abroad this film will be much more successful. In Germany we are not ready for this yet, but the whole world is waiting for Daniel. Richard
Probably all those people who have voted for 'awful' for this movie have never seen it because it was a film made for fans and only about 30.000 people in Germany have seen it. Just to inform those who have never heard about Daniel Küblböck I would like to give some information and background. Daniel took part in the German Idol where he finished 3rd. He certainly was not a very good singer at that time but a brilliant performer and thousands of Germans voted for him and he was shown in TV almost every day. Then there was a voting for the most important German and Daniel was on Place 16 - the German people voted for him NOT HE HIMSELF. Since then he was dissed wherever possible, in TV and in the German press. Non of the other prominent people could believe that such a young boy was in front of them and started to talk bad about him wherever possible. A lot of men cannot stand him because he is everything else than a macho type and THAT is not acceptable in Germany. He likes to laugh and wants to make people smile and his motivation is 'Positive Energy'. He never attacked or said bad things about anybody. Press and TV have made a good job during the last year and take him now as example for bad politics, bad football, bad everything. Daniel's movie was produced by Uli Lommel who was fascinated by this youngster when he saw him on stage when he gave a concert for about 2000 to 3000 fans in Munich. The movie shows now exactly a part of his life. A lot of his fans adore him but also a lot of Germans just hate him. The movie wants to make clear that there is no sense in hating but try to understand other people. As you can see from most of the comments here hardly anybody understood the sense of the movie (have never seen it). It is fact that there are lots of German people who put their whole energy and bad feelings just on a (now) 19 year old boy. If you talk to 'normal' people about this, they just shake their heads and cannot understand it. But these 'sick' people meet on internet sites like 'Let's kill Küblböck' and others and now you can also recognize why this movie got this bad votes. Last but not least just a little information on Daniel. He has improved his voice a lot and gave in December two unplugged concerts in Munich (sold out) where he performed in a super atmosphere and everybody attending this concert was delighted about his 'new voice'.
"Daniel der Zauberer" is a magical mystery story of love an hate.It's an Art-House film about the problems of the unhappy German people with a lucky boy, who makes what he wants. It's no fiction! "Daniel" plays himself. In the autumn 2002 he went to a casting-show. He was just 17 and came out of the deep bavarian forest - he was quite naive. His voice wasn't the best, but his performance was very special and original. Some people loved this natural talent and other (real) German people said: Only someone who worked hard on his voice and choreography can be a star! By this way: This voting is manipulated from people, which like to hate Daniel! The story goes on... Sorry, but my English is very bad.
