This is one hell of laugh riot mainly because of the hero's ineptness. The idea of bad acting can be subjective but this highly incompetent wussy's bad acting is universal truth. Even the kindest of people will get sadistic pleasure whenever he gets beaten in the movie. There is nothing to write home about this abomination apart from the moralistic idea, just the idea. But the screenplay, direction and acting are laughably incompetent. Gracy Singh seems to be on an ordeal of exploring austere side of life: from being in all-time great movies like Lagaan and Munnabhai MBBS to being the love interest of a good-for-nothing character, played by a good-for-nothing actor.
He calls himself an 'uttar bharatiya' (north Indian) and keeps crying himself hoarse about the second class treatment meted out to him and his fellow uttar bharatiyas by the political class of Maharashtra. - TOI Despite its obvious flaws, this writer took guilty pleasure in enjoying this genre where most love songs are actually dreams, where emotions are always displayed loudly, where the villains are always obvious and the hero can do almost anything despite being random. Acting : 1/10 (There is no negative marking) Although they have good actors like Yashpal Sharma, Gracy Singh, Mukesh Tiwari. (Not sarcasm,they are actually actors)But our superstar(Sarcasm) KRK brings down the pace to another level.
I gave 1 star just because i couldn't give half star rating. Awful acting, poor movie plot, and most pathetic thing about this movie is its lead actor "Kamal R Khan". Even 2 year old kid can act better than him. This movie doesn't deserve more than a half star rating. looks like actors, director and even writers didn't get any money For this movie. Only word suits to this movie is "Chutiyaapa"... Don't miss the fun fact of this movie: Kamaal R Khan farted a lot during the dance sequences, making him unbearable for shooting... LOL So if you are drunk and out of your mind think thousand times before watching this sh**. Even sh** is better than this movie. Lol
Successfully Wasted 2 hours and 19 minutes of my life. pathetic movie
This movie is cancer to your eyes. terrible story, pathetic acting undoubtedly worst one in cinema history.
Movie: Deshdrohi Rating: 0.5/5Very rarely do people come across such "mastsrpieces" overloaded with extreme silliness and tomfoolery. DESHDROHI is a masterpiece in this regard. The makers wanted to make an action, crime, drama and thriller film but ended up making a comedy film indeed. I had a great laugh at the poorly written and delivered dialogues, bad general knowledge of the lead actor, funny fight scenes and what not. But it's true it wasn't supposed to be a comedy film, that's why it's an epic Disaster. The self proclaimed critic KRK, who's hardly liked by anyone, proves why. Well there's nothing to talk about this guy as everyone knows. The scenes involving him fighting and delivering one liners are unintentionally so funny that you'll even get pain in your mouth. Surprisingly, there's a presence of big actors too and they do nothing except showering extremely downing performances.The screenplay is weak, extremely and rather so much that it irritates at a point. Songs after song irritates. Action scenes are poorly choreographed and laughable to watch, with even more hilarious BGM. Dialogues are spoken in such a funny way one will die laughing. Though a fistful of shots are good, it's regrettable to say that even emotional scenes look funny. KRK's voice: When he's getting beaten, shot or even crying: is so funny that it makes you think whether DESHDROHI is any film or a spoof. What's good is the writer's dig at the situation north Indians face in states like Maharashtra. But, The present situation has changed a lot. The film is a blatant effort to turn a shoddy looking guy into a gangster-esque hero who can remember the names of freedom fighters but can't tell the right number of states in India (Laugh and feel ashamed!). In other words, the film had potential, but a bad casting and laughable execution killed the film entirely. The film goes some bit above disastrous verdict in a few parts in the first half where I thought I could rare it 1/5, but the film after that second half was so cringe-inducing, that I thought 0.5/5 is the best for the film. People either just keeping shouting or try making you shout. It's not that it's entertaining if it's unintentionally funny. It's quite boring too. Negative reactions keep coming out from your mouth while watching it.The music is bad. Editing was...just leave it. Every other department underscores. Even visually the film doesn't engage you. I was myself surprised how I couldn't remember the last scene I watched. It was that bad.Overall, DESHDROHI is an epic masterpiece disaster which is worth skipping for life. I just wanted to risk my sleep, my peace and my silence, and thus I watched it. And now I realized the essence of the film's title. It needs not to be told that even making such films is called Deshd...Disciplined people like me and many can use decent words but haters can even turn to abuses. What else to say? A big DISASTER (Sorry makers, don't take it personally. There are many people who have similar opinions, how many would you be unhappy with?) Note: For more fun and laughter, check the film's budget and collection at Boxofficeindia.com.
What to tell about this movie. Don't go on the genre Action+Thriller. Actually this is a funny movie. You haven't seen a funny movie in you life like this. Hero of this movie- The great KRK; can't act, can't dance, can't run, can't fight. There is no such a work which he can do in this movie. This movie is a masterpiece and should be used for torturing the terrorists.
Just look at the poster of this movie and Does any HUMAN BEING would want to go through this torture.For the sake of humanity don't watch this.
This is not a movie, it's hate against humanity. kamal khan has waged jihad against art
This movie was unbearable I was unable to Watch it this is the crappiest movie I have ever watched in my whole life.
Just don't watch it!!!
This is one of the worst movie you'll ever see so please don't watch it
This movie talks about unity of India, this is what our Country needs. This movie is about politics, corruption and a common man. after watching this movie I am very happy that Kamal Khan has made this type of movie which can open our minds and makes us think why we are fighting and hating each other. An unemployed RAJA(KK) comes of Mumbai in search of a job. Staying in Mumbai for RAJA is not easy and he soon realizes that being a North Indian is even tougher. The main highlights of this film is its powerful dialogues. Movies like this should always be appreciated. Watch this good movie to know how Raja and Sonia teach lessons to the criminals?
This is one of those great old movies that is worth a repeat viewing every now and again in a person's life.Be that as it may, the story that is told here is every bit as important and thought provoking.Throughout the film there is a spot-on wisdom about man and his endless quest for justice.I came away from this movie feeling secure in my belief that in life you just can't have it all, but a true patriot can.Since this movie was largely about "North Indians (literally speaking Yadavs, it must have made quite an impression on audiences back who share the same last name and hail from the north India).I'm sure more than a few viewers still have painful memories of catastrophic losses caused by the recent feuds and the aftermath that followed.That's why I think this movie qualifies for repeat viewings, because just think how appropriate this wisdom is for our current generation of people "Fortunes come and go, gold is often times nothing but dust in the wind, but life goes on and so man must go on. That's what this movie says to me whenever I see it."
I saw this movie after my exams hoping to get some entertainment i wasn't disappointed at all.this MOVIE IS A OUT N OUT ENTERTAINER..whether its the pathetic screenplay, hopeless dialogs or horrendous acting, it never fails to crack you up..OH yes i almost forgot to mention that the acting is really bad as well..its almost like a really long and extended spoof of some kind..positives: there arn't many , but i guess the theme of this movie is very relevant today. so if uve watched it and had your laugh, the good thing to take home is that we are all Indians and are one people. don't waste money on this one, its barely worth a DVD watch.
The film belongs to the genre of "Gunda". It is a laugh riot and contains iconic scenes. There is a scene where the owner of a food stall starts beating KRK at night because he did not pay him. In the very next shot he is seen continuing to beat him in broad day light. Just goes to show the sloppy and tacky editing. It is so bad that it is good. KRK's dance movies are cringe worthy and so is his smile. Both the heroines of the movie look like Madhubalas while sharing screen with him. The movie is best watched with a group of old buddies and bear. Just bitch the crap out of the movie as you watch it. I feel the many negative reviews are not justified. Why? Movies are meant to entertain and I bet you will enjoy laughing at the movie.
