A group of African-American college students head out to the country for a weekend of fun and find themselves being slaughtered instead in this film written and directed by Michael Mfume. Sadly, the killer's first victim must've been the sound man because barely a word spoken in this film is audible. Now let's be honest folks. We users of the IMDb tend to be a little too quick in declaring that this or that film the worst one ever made. People have certainly done that about this film too. The difference is that this time they are right! This film is simply unwatchable. Even cheese-lovers will be tempted to poke their eyes out. So many people have complained the time they wasted watching this DVD. Well, I'm one up on you. I actually saw this movie in the theater! That's right, back when it was made, around 1992, the film managed to get limited theatrical release in Mfume's hometown of Baltimore. (This disservice to the movie-going public was probably as a result of the fact that Mfume's father was a US Congressman from Baltimore at the time.) The film was originally called "The Weekend It Lives." I don't think I walked out on the movie. I was with some friends and I believe we were all too stunned to move. As stunned as I was at the time, I am even more stunned that someone actually released it on DVD. It's not simply that the movie is bad. There are plenty of bad movies out there, and I enjoy many of them. What surprises me about this film is it's total lack of film-making competence. The sound is horrible, as if they were only using the built-in microphone on a camcorder. The picture is almost as bad. I have seen better films made by grade school students.
I was once happy. There was a time for me when life seemed worth living. There was a time when my mind wasn't constantly flooded with images of my own eviscerated corpse hanging from a noose. That was the time before I saw Ax 'Em.The term "worst movie ever made" is thrown around quite often to describe films of this nature. No one ever anticipates, however, that somewhere in the world, there honestly is a worst movie ever made. I'm not one to make assumptions, but I seriously believe that this is, in fact, the greatest cinematic travesty in history. It's like this Mfume guy sat down and wrote a list of every movie-making no-no that could ever be committed, and then made it a point to stuff every single one of these into one incredibly terrible film (and I use the term "film" quite loosely).The first thing you'll notice is that there seem to be about six or seven different cameras used, each one more awful than the last. The sound quality is horrendous in ways that simply cannot be understood until you see the movie. The plot seems to be that a bunch of African American individuals dressed in clothing that would've been considered fashionable in 1991 running around trying not to get killed by some sort of zombie/psycho or something. I think. I'm really not sure.Despite the title, the killer guy only uses an ax like, once. He mostly uses a machete or a gun.The horrid nature of this film is absolutely mind-boggling in a way that makes you wonder how such a thing even exists.I've still not completely banished the theory that Mfune made this with the intention of creating some sort of bizarre ironic comedy movie. If this is true, then he should be hailed as a genius.
When I watched "Ax 'Em" I found myself wondering one simple thing: How did this movie get distributed?  Honestly, it is that bad.  The film quality and sound quality are non-existent.  Honestly, I've seen better quality from a VHS camcorder in a dark room recording Barbies.  The plot is so asinine that I can't believe Michael Mfume actually got as many people to be in it as he did.  I guess the best comparison of this movie is "The Evil Dead" made by Sam Raimi and a bunch of his friends (including Bruce Campbell) when they were in college.  You could compare it to that, the only difference is while "The Evil Dead" is extremely well done for its budget and limited crew, this movie is just plain awful.The title is spelled differently on the box than it is on the movie itself. There is really no ax in the movie at all, there is a small hatchet though. Words are misspelled everywhere in the movie's introduction.  The opening credits look like something that could have been made on a 1986 camcorder and there is no editing.  The same scene appears in the movie twice in a row.  You really can't understand anything that the characters say, the sound is that bad.The movie starts out with a bunch of young people dancing when a "Yo Momma" contest breaks out, and from here it actually goes downhill if you can believe that.  When a group of characters like Rock and Breakfast go on a trip to a cabin in the middle of nowhere they are stalked by some guy.  I'm not really sure if there was some connection there, but it was just basically some guy whose family was killed or something and now he's out for revenge.This is a good movie for people who like bad movies.  There are many parts that are so bad they are funny, although usually this isn't a good things in movies.  If there was a way to give this film a zero I would.1 out of 10.
Without exaggeration, I can safely say that this is the absolutely worst, most low-rent movie I have ever seen in my life. It simply has to be seen to be believed, and even when I was watching it I could hardly believe what I was seeing. Everything about it is atrocious from the effects to the "acting". For one thing, I have never seen a movie that had a box around the picture. It's really hard to believe that this isn't someones bad student picture that accidently got on the shelves of the video store. The fact that this movie was actually distributed boggles my mind. The sound is so bad you can't hear half of what's being said. The direction is non-existent. The characters are the dumbest, most annoying jerks ever. The effects are so cheap they belong in an Ed Wood movie, not in a film made in 2002. The production values are worse that Manos: the Hands of Fate (chew on that for awhile). I can't say enough how phenomenally bad this movie is. Michael MFume, I hope you are hanging your head in shame.
THis movie is amazing. I rented it from Hollywood Video after hearing it was the worst film ever, I though, "A movie worse than The Item? A Miracle!" No this is not worse than The Item. I rented it on VHS, and the small screen is funny as heck. Then I had to, I had to buy the DVD. The DVD sucks. No disc menu, and they enlarged the screen! The sound is supposed to be stereo sound or whatever but you still cant hear them....friggin hysterical. This movie has so many problems, it is just funny. I cant wait to show this crap to my friends. Check this one out if you wanna see a bad, bad, bad, bad movie. But get it on VHS cause of the small screen. Makes the movie funnier. Micheal Mfume we love you!!!!!!
Sloppy horror film - and it shows - about a group of not-so-bright teens on a weekend getaway in the woods targeted by a hulking maniac whose family was murdered years earlier.  Amateur film (shot on a camcorder) suffers due to terrible acting, writing, directing and editing.  More than half the film is muted so you can't hear what everybody is saying.  The only thing that comes in clear is the rap music.  If you rent this trash to get some laughs out of this, you'll be disappointed.  Rent "Scary Movie," instead.  My evaluation: (no stars).
Even though I give Ax'Em a 1/10 I still want people to see it. Its one of those movies thats so bad its funny. Ax'Em is a horror/slasher movie that was supposed to be serious but it ended up like more of a comedy. Ax'Em was directed by Michal Mfume who looks like he hasn't done anything sense.Ax'Em is about several young people who go to the woods for a vacation. What they don't know is that a killer who came back from the dead is out to get them. Before they go out to the woods there is a little get together in which there is dancing and a 'yo mamma' battle breaks out. I guess Michal Mfume is just filming anything and putting it in the movie. Nothing says good horror movie than a yo mamma battle. The killer in this movie is a real mess. First the movie is called Ax'Em and the killer doesn't even use an ax. He uses a hatchet, a machete and a baseball bat. Plus the killer poses for the camera.Ax'Em has many flaws including hearing the director say CUT in one scene, and another scene is shown twice in a row for no reason at all. There are more. Ax'Em is a funny movie thats horribly acted, directed written and acted. Its a bad horror movie but a good comedy.
AX EM, an "urban" flick purportedly about a slasher, is one of only two movies I have given a "1" rating here. The other is NIGHT OF THE GHOULS. I would place MANOS in the same category, but I forget if I ever wrote about it here. AX EM is not a film, and it is hardly even a home movie. It was shot using a camcorder and the cam's mike, so that the sound -- uncorrected, natch -- is beyond the point of muddy. AX EM makes that dancing killer scarecrow movie and that pot-bellied mummy movie look like CITIZEN KANE. A big piece of the running time is given over to footage of an actual urban parade! AX EM is truly unwatchable. I should have known better. I rented it from a store, behind which sits a huge Section 8 housing project. Truly a numbnuts film for numbnuts.
If there is one saving grace to "Ax 'Em", it's that there is about a 10-minute window where the film becomes the funniest movie I've ever seen in a long time. Unfortunately it's just 10 minutes worth of laughs (including a white victim who keeps falling down as per the usual black critique of white victims in horror movies). The film itself is visually atrocious. I don't really know what happened, but my bet would be that the filmmaker shot the film in 16MM, transferred to tape in order to edit it, but somehow forgot about tape degradation that comes with generational dubbing. As a result, nearly half of "Ax 'Em" looks like a grainy home video, only that would be insulting rainy home videos. This is, incidentally, perfect fodder for Mystery Science Theater 3000, if only that show was still around.
So what do you get when you google one of you co-workers names.... You find out that he was the Editor (George Bolden) of what many seem to think is the worst movie produced of all time. At first when I found Ax 'Em I asked George, a guy I have know for several years, if he was the same George Bolden. He denied it! George is a Local TV/Movie editor in the Baltimore area where this movie was produced, so I knew there was more to the story than he was letting on. After much poking and prodding he admitted to having done the editing on this film. As I have not yet seen the movie, my copy is on order from Amazon for 79 cents, I can not give a full opinion of the movie. But, I do guarantee to give him hell about this for as long as I can... This is one of those stories that is just too good to be true. We intend to plaster his office with all of the very colorful comments on this movie. A bunch of us at work anxiously await the arrival of the movie. We intend to que this one up at work for all to see. On a side note, George said he edited half the movie from VHS tapes because the producer lost the original film... And on top of that, apparently the director stiffed him. George was never paid for this film... but it still has his name one it... Lucky Him.... no wait Lucky Us. Can't stop laughing.
A 1 is way to much credit for this movie! After the first 16 seconds, the best way for this movie to possibly have ended was for each character to simultaneous kill themselves... at least then it would have been over! By far the worst movie of all time, makes Killjoy look like a masterpiece. The only acceptable argument for this not being the worst movie ever is that it's not a movie... just a random grouping of totally unrelated scenes that make no since on there own. Not to mention that every scene is the most annoying scene you'll ever see. Every minute that you watch this movie, you keep telling yourself, "There's no way this could possibly get any worse"... and then it does... every time. The people responsible for this movie should be required by law to never make another movie, under penalty of death... it would make the world a better place ;)
Ax-EM is hilarious. It is so poorly made you will not believe it. This movie has so many mistakes I broke out laughing.Here are some. 1)You can here the director say "CUT" in one scene. 2)One scene is shown twice in a row. 3)The sound is so bad you cant here what people are saying. 4)The opening summery is not spelled right. There are probably many more that I did not see because I was so busy laughing.Overall Ax-Em is not a horror film. In fact there is not an ax in this movie.(there is a hatchet...yeah...close enough?)This is a total comedy.If the director makes another film I want to see it.Go rent it to see how bad/good this is.(P.S. This is my first review I have written for this website)
I don't know how this piece of crap ever got funding to begin with. Other posters have correctly noted the awful film quality; it is grainy and the cuts to other scenes are harsh. In addition, there is no real plot, at least not one that hasn't been recycled 47 times before. Killer on the loose; run away in the woods.Over all, it looks to me like this was some poor kid's film school final project. The trouble is that he was attending a 5th rate film school and got an F and now works at a Burger King.This movie is only worth your time if you enjoy watching absolute garbage like I do.
I hated this movie. I got a headache just watching it. My dad bought it for me for my birthday and I didn't even watch the whole thing. It didn't fit my screen, it look like a movie my friends and I would make. This movie is a waste of time and money.
David Turner from The Cosmonaut Variety Hour's episode, 'The Worst Horror Movie Ever Made', brought me here. That is all I can say as I needed to know this film existed, which is does.
Okay, so this movie is absolutely terrible. but seriously, you gotta love a movie this bad. Honestly, if you go to any blockbuster (i'm fairly sure they are legally required to carry the movie in all stores for reasons i won't go into now), and if you're looking for a film full of mistakes, bad dialogue, very bad directing, and even worse plot line, but with fairly hilarious outcomes, i suggest you rent this (don't buy it because michael mfume would get some sort of royalties, and he really shouldn't) , even for a night of laughs. this movie is quite possibly the worst movie ever made, however i have never laughed so much as i have watching this movie.

This movie is the funniest, saddest, cheapest, cheesiest, crappiest, boringist, poorly made trash I have ever seen in my life...and I loved it!!! What a lot of the people that saw this movie don't realize is that they have just seen movie history. You can not dispute the fact that this is the worst movie ever made. Just sit back and get ready to laugh!! Funnier than any comedy I have ever seen. This movie is unforgettable. I want to meet Michael Mfume and shake his hand. He has given every amateur, untalented filmmaker new hope. I first saw this movie three years ago, and I still laugh every time I talk about it.My cousin and I have made movies with a camcorder and $200 budgets. Don't doubt me when I say , that they are all better than this.Forget about renting a movie that you'll see and then try to remember any parts from later. Even the best movies are forgotten. This one won't be...which is what makes it the best bad movie ever.
I downloaded this movie off a website on a whim one day. I was a little worried due to the overwhelming amount of negative reviews on IMDb.Little did i know that this movie would change my life.This movie is pure genius. I haven't seen such a terrifying albeit poignant film. Id recommend this masterpiece to all ages.Don't listen to the reviews watch the movie and make up your own mind about it! Im sure you'll enjoy it tremendously!The actors do a fantastic job of portraying their characters. Especially Michael Mfume who played the main character alongside directing, producing and writing this film. What an extraordinary talent!This movie was also made on a less than $1000 budget making the film even better! If you would like to watch a great movie that will scare and inspire you then this is the one for you!10/10
This film is an absolute masterpiece. The sheer amount of quality this movie has is unparalleled. Not even Hitchcock himself could ever dream of creating such a terrifying yet character driven horror movie. The characters with the most development (Breakfast and DJ Slice Em Up Dice Em Up) are completely and utterly fantastic. Absolutely would recommend, mainly as a watch with friends.
