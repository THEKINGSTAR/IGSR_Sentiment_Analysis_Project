Let's see. There was the idea that seven women without any sort of training of any kind would bring down a drug kingpin. There was the fact that none of these women ever thought to call in the police. There was the drug kingpin who stored millions of dollars of drugs in a ludicrously unguarded "processing compound." There was this famous pop star who can apparently get around Los Angeles completely unrecognized. There was a "Vietnamese" character with a Japanese name. There was this high school girl hanging on to the trunk of a Caddy, uncommented upon by other drivers, as it sped through LA.There were appearances by such actors as Jack Palance, Jim Backus(if you watch MST3K's version, Angel's Revenge, you can actually hear Mike and the bots groan when Backus makes his appearance), Peter Lawford(Tom Servo: "Do you think Peter Lawford even knows where he is?") and Arthur Godfrey. And there were plot holes aplenty and lots more awfulness besides this.All of this and more make for one of the worst movies ever made by anyone. That anybody thought this was a good idea and that actors of the caliber of Jack Palance agreed to participate is mind-boggling. Watch the MST3K version which is one of their best efforts.
From the Halls of Great Pain at MST3K headquarters comes an uncalled for rip off of Charlie's Angels, Angels Revenge (Brigade)!Here, a few good actors and a lot of bad ones unite in a barage of shameful "starring" parts to make the real main characters look like good actors- the seven foxy ladies.  Their mission- to act like they are trying to bust up a drug ring.  They fail at the acting part though. The ladies who aren't white are all bad stereotypes, and their acting makes baywatch look like the a Meryl Streep movie.  The only thing resembling a saving grace are that they are hot.  Thats it.  Other than that, every other actor makes me want to watch the Shakespearean techniques of Manos.  Jack Palance is terrible, in perhaps one of the few movies he has been in (must hve been early in his career), the rejects from sitcoms make up the cameos, and what the hell was Peter Lawford doing in this?  Wait nevermind.  I just realized he was drunk and stoned most of the movie. That explains it. Well, the story has the ladies doing various things while "acting" to destroy the drug ring, including robbing a very shameful Jim Backus, slicing up a drug dealers genitals in a "humorous" scene, seducing two fishermen finding drugs (in a scene akin to watching whales mate), and making the viewer vomit through every other scene.Skip this movie at all costs, unless, of course, you see it on MST3K.  It will drain all hope and beauty from your world, as well as all the vomit from your stomach.
For a very long time I've wondered if a lot of bad movies would eventually get what they deserved... AND THIS heap of crap got it! A good Thrashing from our pals on Mystery Science Theater 3000! I'm so utterly disgusted by the acting on the part of the women in this movie that the only way I could stand it was while Mike, Crow and Tom Servo throw great jokes at the stupidity and insanity on the screen. To be frank, can't we just destroy every copy of this film and pretend it never existed?
I've been watching a lot of MST3K lately, mainly because my girlfriend and I enjoy them and have thirty of them on DVD. We had been on a roll, blindly picking out some of the funniest MSTs ever (Overdrawn at the Memory Bank, Time Chasers, et al). Then along came Angels Revenge. (That's how the filmmakers title it -- it should be Angels' Revenge.) This is the epitome of bad film-making. The plot comes straight from what must have been a hormone-crazed, cocaine-snorting man with money. There are more holes in this movie than a particularly hole-filled piece of Swiss cheese. Seven completely unrelated women come together to overthrow a drug kingpin (Peter Lawford) and the most ridiculous plot points ensue. The movie opens with an hour long flashback featuring bad singing and dancing routines, "action" sequences riddled with cartoon sound effects (hearing a "boing!" and a "thwap!" during these scenes is pure camp), and it attempts to explain how these seven crime fighters came to be. It's really just a reason to show the T&A on these minorly attractive women. (I will say I laughed when Tom Servo said to the black stunt driving woman of this group, "Hey, Gene Shalit wants his hair back!") The acting is stretching the meaning of the definition of acting awfully thin, despite appearances by Alan Hale (the Skipper), Jim Baccus (Mr. Howell), and even Jack Palance as the middleman in this drug ring. The first time he approaches the teacher-cum-crime fighter character, Crow says (in Jack's voice), "I want to be teacher's pet," followed quickly by, "Hey, what's with this 'incomplete' crap?" Suffice it to say that the "acting" on display here is the reason they make acting schools. None of the leading women apparently attended.I really like MST3K, but even Mike and the 'bots struggled through this one. Some movies are just so bad that making fun of them almost becomes difficult to watch. This is a prime example of one of those movies.
Even watching this from the relative safety of MST3K, I felt offended at the events being shown.  Jack Palance running around in that suit!  Alan Hale, never being able to escape the role of The Skipper, and Mr. Howell er, Jim Backus, throwing away whatever dignity he had.  Then there's our main characters.  A very broad (no pun intended) range of just about every ethnicity, job, stereotype that you could think of.  Very bad acting from our leading ladies here.  I would like to think that Jack took this role on advice from his agent, who was probably drunk, and then quickly fired him. On a slightly different note, the cinematographer was one Dean Cundey.  He has since gone on to bigger and better films such as Apollo 13.
"Angels' Brigade" is about as angelic as a root canal. Seemingly produced for a bunch of men whose hormones outweigh their body mass, the movie follows a bunch of big-breasted women who set out to bring down a drug kingpin's empire. Since there's not really any plot, the movie is mainly noticeable because it stars two "Gilligan's Island" cast members: Alan Hale and Jim Backus (and wouldn't you know it, they don't even get to share any scenes). Although I gave the movie one star, it gets five out of four stars when shown on "MST3K", and that's only because it gives Mike, Servo and Crow an incentive to come up with some great comments. I'd say that that episode was their most "Gilligan's Island"-related, not just because "Angels' Brigade" stars the Skipper and Mr. Howell, but also because certain scenes prompt Mike and the 'bots to mention Bob Denver, Natalie Schaefer and Tina Louise (what, no Russell Johnson or Dawn Wells?).
Big breasts and nice bums are not enough for me.  In my opinion there are not that many attractive people in this piece of junk besides.  What really irks me about this movie is supposed righteous theme that is presented by our heroines.  Drugs are bad, everyone knows this, but why did they see it fit to become crimefighters?  They never really did go for the police, nor sought any type of help...instead this motley crew finds it necessary to fight for themselves.  Without any experience, the audience has to make a leap of faith that these women know what they are doing.  Seven untrained, naive women are going to bring down the entire empire of a drug lord. In a matter of days, these unheard and unknown group of seven women from backgrounds that have nothing to do with crimefighting, become a highly organized group that is able to take down this drug lord or any type of evil in the world. This story has so many lapses of logic, that I bet whoever wrote it never thought of proofreading; I compare it to a term paper written the night before.  A completely icky movie.
I can hardly image how a film could be worse then this abomination of celluloid. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM! There is nothing good about it. This is the first film that has ever made me consider suicide as a way to make the film end (and I am not joking about that one). Words can not describe how bad this movie is.
This movie is horrible.  Absolutely horrible.  Every scene of this movie makes me want to cry and wish I was never born.  Without Mike and the bots I don't think anyone could make it through this absolutely horrible piece of movie.  You will lose many things while watching this movie.  Your lunch, will to live, appetite.  And you will become a little person curled up in a corner the rest of your life.  Thank god for MST3K.
Ah, you didn't let me finish.  I highly recommend this movie, presented in MST3K's point of view.  Only the masters of MST could make this fright-fest bearable.  Standing alone, this movie belongs in the waste basket of movies to be forgotten. I think all involved in the movie would agree as well, especially Mr. Palance.
MST3K has featured a ton of bad movies, but this is probably the most cringe-inducing movie they've done. Only "Hobgoblins" comes second. Funny as the episode is, there are moments where I have to wince at this movie even with the jokes. The horrible "acting" from the leading ladies who were obviously hired for their looks instead of their acting ability, the assemblage of washed up TV stars, the Hanna Barbera sound effects...I could go on but just thinking of this movie makes me ill.
There is one good thing about this movie, and that's singer Patty Foley's voice. (She sings "Shine Your Love"--not the height of disco music, but it does show off her voice for a moment.) Otherwise, the movie is crap from top to bottom. Script and acting get the worst grades, but nothing here is good.I worry about people who think women dressed and acting like this are sexy. It's a lowlife, slimy sexuality, like getting a lap dance from a trembling drug addict with festering open sores. Ewww-sexuality, making 1950's dirty comic books look pleasant and sophisticated in comparison. Pandering to those men (and perhaps a few women) who find this sort of thing sexy was the raison d'etre for this awful, awful movie. So if you're one of those guys, have at it. If you're anyone else, make sure the hot water heater is working for the long shower you'll want to take after watching this. The "plot" and "action" are the film are pasted on to excuse the T & A and deserve no mention.Not even MST3K jokes can make me watch this all the way through a second time.
Brain-dead jiggle-fest? Why, yes indeed, you've come to the right place.Angel's Revenge/Brigade is basically "Charlie's Angels" with twice the number of cast members (six women - plus a 'high school teenager' - instead of three) and approximately 1/10th of the talent. Would be first time viewers should adjust their expectations accordingly.Look, no one is ever going to list Kate Jackson, Farrah Fawcett, etc., among the great actresses of the '70s, but the original Angels had a lot of charm and charisma, and they could deliver their lines, interact with each other, do their stage business and blocking, and hit their marks like the professionals they were. It was all facile dreck, but it was professional level dreck.On the other hand, "Angel's Brigade" features seven of the stiffest, most unconvincing and grating actresses on the planet. The women are moderately hot (except for the lanky black actress, who is saddled with a huge afro that makes her look like a human dandelion ), but they simply C-A-N-N-O-T deliver convincing readings of their lines. The director seems to realize this, and so he dumbs down the proceedings in an attempt to avoid making the girls show any kind of recognizable human emotion...and the resulting screenplay is so bad, so lame, that it takes genuine talents like Jack Palance, Peter Lawford, and Arthur Godfrey (and several longtime character actors like Jim Backus) and simply embarrasses them with idiotic throwaway parts that completely waste their talents. Lawford, Godfrey, and Backus, especially, all appear to be hammered out of their skulls..it's as if they couldn't be bothered to sober up long enough to appear even in the briefest scenes.God, the whole thing is just so inane...I know this thing is not meant to be taken seriously, that it is just a goof, but it's so damned careless and annoying. One Angel disables a thug by opening a beach umbrella in his face. Another Angel takes out a thug with a back-fist accompanied by a Hanna-Barbera 'BOINK!' sound effect.A third Angel takes a hit to her, um, talents, but she has a life raft tucked under her shirt which protects her and she makes an indignant face and pulls out the raft and bonks the thug over the head with it...it's not funny and light hearted, it's just STUPID.MST3K struggled mightily to have fun with this one, and their commentary is almost enough to turn this into a watchable experience. I can't imagine trying to watch this one 'straight'.Avoid the original version like the plague. Even the jiggles and the jumpsuits aren't compensation enough for the pain of the performances and the screenplay.
An extended jiggle-fest made watchable only through the gracious lens of "Mystery Science Theatre 3000", "Angels' Bridage" (aka "Angels' Revenge") is a truly embarrassing rip-off of "Charlie's Angels" seemingly written and directed by hormone-crazed 16-year-old boys and starring an overwhelming number of has-been B-movie character actors.The plot, as much as there is one, involves a quasi-feminist schoolteacher trying to take out a drug ring that pushes to kids.  She enlists the aid of six stereotypes...er, I mean characters: a sassy black stunt driver, an Asian martial artist (of course), a disco singer, an oversexed model, a tough cop that loves her weaponry, and a bratty, annoying teenager who happens to be one of the teacher's students.  This movie is filled with things that will either make you laugh, cringe, or simply scratch your head, depending on your tolerance for horrid cinema. There's the Vietnamese character with the Japanese name.  The singer whose record is "still climbing" up the charts but is still recognized by every character in the film.  The "top model" who does her fashion shoots in a mall parking lot.  Jim Backus in thigh-high military boots.  A genital-mutilation-as-interrogation scene played for laughs.  A squad of bouncy women who paint their nails and wear spiked heels on a commando raid. And don't forget the score, which rips off all sorts of recognizable music, from the theme to "Charlie's Angels" to John Williams' opening music for "Jaws" to Strauss' "Thus Spake Zarathustra" (also known as the music from "2001: A Space Odyssey").See what Aaron Spelling hath wrought?  1 out of 10.
Ow, it stings!  Angel's Revenge is one of those movies that makes you smile, laugh, feel confusion, and extreme pain all at the same time.  The makers of this one probably thought, "There's enough rubes out there who'd be fooled into thinking this is Charlie's Angels, so let's make a movie!"  The result is a movie full of made-for-TV preservative preservatives.  Some scenes are so laughably ridiculous like the drug compound and it's poorly defended facility.  That's what Peter Lawford gets for hiring Jack Palance!  After seeing a share of Bs, I have grown an appreciation of seeing Jack in low budget schlockers, but this film hurts so much that he's not even in the majority of the film!  Probably out boozing it up with Pete backstage. Beware of Jim Bacchus in his role...be warned!  This movie doesn't take itself seriously which becomes apparent really really soon.The gals are definitely eye candy...and that's about it!  Acting was not a prerequisite nor was having any dignity for being involved with this film! Watch the action sequences and why no action choreographer was hired (that would blow the entire budget!).  Just your  stereotypical big explosions, car chases, A-Team rip-off wannabe van, a girl hanging on to the trunk of a car, bouncing on trampoline, and so much more.  See this MST style and see Mike, Tom, and Crow boogie down to the sultry singing of Michelle Wilson!
I am not a so bad its good fan. I have never been big on the whole ironic viewing experience. Even with mediocre films that I enjoyed there was something I honestly liked about them. But now I am torn because other then the women I can't think of a reason to like this film and yet I did. Does that mean I am shallow, quite possibly. Does it mean I just like staring at cleavage, can't argue with that. But usually it takes a lot more then eye candy to get me to like a film but there is something about this one that gets me.The plot is simple, street pusher (Darby Hinton) sells drugs to children and no one can stop him except of course the seven from heaven. A school teacher, a vegas lounge singer, a martial arts instructor, a model, a stunt woman, a cop and a high school student all join forces to bring down the drugdealer's boss, the kingpin Peter Lawford who along with his right hand man Jack Palance seems to have cornered the primary school drug racket. The women are all gorgeous with special mention going to Playboy playmate and H.O.T.S star Susan Kiger as the singer. If you can keep your eyes from drifting lower during her sequences you are a far better man than I am.The film gets more bizarre as it goes along as these Magnificent Seven (or actually 14 if you consider how they are costumed) seem to bring down the bad guys with relative ease. This film was clearly aimed at young kids so no one ever poses any real threat to them. When one of the ladies are captured they only dump her in a pool tied to a tea set. Director Greydon Clark (a favorite of mine) helps keep everything moving at a fast clip and the actresses are all quite likable which makes it a big improvement over his previous film Satan's Cheerleaders.If you are nervous about watching this film pick up the MST3K version. The movie is shortened so it is even faster paced and their humour helps it through some slow patches. But if you have only seen that version you should keep your eyes out for the original on VHS. You will be surprised at just how watchable it is.
Oh, this film is horrible, make no mistake about it. The reason I gave it a 7 is because it's so bad as a straight-faced movie that it's an A+ as garbage! This film is really really bad, I don't have to tell you that. But if you are looking for a few hours of "oh my God, I can't believe they made this", it's not bad. MST3K spoofed it awhile back, and it's one of their better episodes. And, get this -- I knew Susan Kiger (AKA - the singer)! She is still hot, and a very sweet person. I was watching the MST3K version one day, and realized -- OHMYGOD, I know her! I brought it up to her, and she laughed and was shocked that I knew the movie. I gave her a copy of the MST3k version (funny, since they rip on her pretty harshly), and she loved it! What a good sport!
Sure, it won't win any prizes for technical achievement or (especially) acting, but it is what it is: lively female-empowerment action entertainment for the drive-in crowd. If you watch this for the stars involved, be warned that some of them were hired basically just for their name value. Still, cult director Greydon Clark ("Without Warning", "Joysticks") keeps this silly diversion racing forward. Some viewers may know this flick for its being lampooned on 'Mystery Science Theater 3000', but the fact of the matter is that this was obviously meant to be played for laughs to begin with.Playboy Playmate Susan Kiger plays Michelle Wilson, a successful singer whose kid brother is beaten up by "Sticks" (Clark regular Darby Hinton), a drug pusher. It takes Michelle no time to take a schoolteacher, April Thomas (the directors' wife, Jacqueline Cole), up on her offer to assist in destroying a processing plant used by dealers. Soon April and Michelle are recruiting other young women, including a stunt driver, Terry Grant (Sylvia Anderson), a martial artist, Kako Umaro (Lieu Chinh), a policewoman, Elaine Brenner (Robin Greer), and a model, Maria (Noela Velasco) to join in the fight against drug trafficking. Meanwhile, a student, Trish (Liza Greer), tries to tag along, wanting to be in on the action.The ladies are lovely and fun to watch, no matter how seriously they may be lacking in acting ability. The veterans & guest stars are likewise thoroughly entertaining, including Jack Palance as a goon and Peter Lawford as the drug kingpin, Jim Backus as a member of a right wing militia, Neville Brand as Elaines' boss, Pat Buttram as a van salesman, and Alan Hale Jr. as Michelles' agent. Legendary TV & radio host Arthur Godfrey appears fleetingly as himself. Palances' son Cody has a small role as a young thug.The movie is often uproariously silly, complete with goofy comedy bits like the one with Backus, and cartoon-like sound effects. The scene transitions are particularly amusing. And there's enough gunfire, explosions, and stunts going on to ensure that things never get boring.Just go into this thing not expecting anything remotely resembling high art, be prepared not to exercise your brain too much, and get ready to laugh, and one *can* actually enjoy this.Eight out of 10.
